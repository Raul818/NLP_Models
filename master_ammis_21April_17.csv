  Ordered food on a Sunday noon!
#1 Delivery- You can actually go to market, get groceries, cook food and have rather then ordering and expecting quick delivery from this restaurant. Delivery was 40 mins late from the ""promised delivery"" time, even though the restaurant is hardly a km away.
#2 Food quality- I think the restaurant gets oil in subsidy, you can actually strain the oil from food and use it to fry pakoras. Food freshness, quality and taste dont even meet below average rating. Except food packing(if ur fascinated about packing), everything seems bad!

And, the tagline,""jab hungry, kuch accha khao"", i would say Starve, than thinking of having from this restaurant.",2,2,3,3,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,1484470888,Ammi's Biryani,Banashankari,1,https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/190/c36a91a7b08b9cf511283b8b67435190.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A,Ankita Naik,https://www.zomato.com/bangalore/ammis-biryani-banashankari,/static/images/zomato.jpg,/static/images/ammislogo1.png,Bangalore,

  One day was very busy with work do decided to order from outside and the mood was for biryani. Thought will try from Ammis for a change and ordered through Foodpanda. We got the parcel within 60mins. Had ordered for one veg hyderabadi biryani and one egg biryani. I was impressed to see the packing but once it was in the mouth all impression vanished. It was like as though someone who is learning to cook had prepared, it was so bad. Curd raitha was just watery and gravy was like oh God I don't even have words to describe it .....so pathetic.

  A really terrible experience! Had ordered 3 Hyderabadi Chicken Dum Biryani's tonight. Firstly, the person on call tells me that nothing else is available on the menu tonight and that the Dum Biryani was the only thing on offer. We still decided to give it a try. And what a bad call on our part. The rice was hard and very cold. The chicken was not cooked properly. The biryani was absolutely tasteless. This is NOT a Dum biryani from any angle. It felt as though they had kept the biryani out in the open all day long for the flies and the weather to do their worst. What a pathetic experience. There was a time (years ago), when their biryanis were delivered piping hot and were good to taste. But now, it feels like we are eating crap.

  After seeing a Veg Hyderabadi Biryani, decided to visit for a lunch at Ammi's. But the Biryani is no where close to Hyderabadi Style. The Biryani Tastes alright & ideal name would be Just a Veg Biryani. However, Aam Panna was top notch & must try! The service was quick & pricing is pretty reasonable. I recommend Ammi's 😊

  I ordered for home delivery from this place today; it's my first experience with them, and I must say I was pleasantly happy with the delivery time and the food too.

What I also liked about them was the fact that they have worked on creating the first impression by working on their neat packing. The delivered food too was hot and could be consumed immediately.

I ordered for Hyderabadi Veg Biryani and the quantity was quite good, however little more vegetables can be included in the same which otherwise tasted quite bland. Considering that it's supposed to be Hyderabadi Biryani, the spice quotient was not as high as it was expected.

  Unless you want to grab Biryani that is less than ok on flavours I would suggest this place. This place was a complete disappointment when it came to starters and sub par flavours on Birayani. Am guessing they are trying to set a fast food standard Biryani Style.

There isn't anything special about their Biryani, the Hyderabadi Biryani is quite ok in flavours and served at luke warm temperatures which is a turn off. Biryani's are meant to be served hot!!

At all costs please avoid the Mutton Seek Kabab's they are complete joke, zero on flavours and not appealing at all.

They do have interesting combo deals and family packs which sound interesting but unfortunately Biryani's are disappointing.

  Ammi's Biriyani, according to me, is over hyped. When it comes to Biriyani, I am a Meghana Foods loyalist. So, when my friends wanted to try Ammi's, i was hesitant and with due reason. When we went there, there was nobody there which made me more apprehensive.
We ordered a Chicken Boneless Biriyani and a Chicken Hyderabadi Biriyani. With it, they give raitha, gravy and a sweet. The raitha had only cucumber, the gravy was watery and the sweet was quite fine. Now coming to the most important.. the Biriyani. Well, both the biriyani's tasted almost the same with hardly any difference in taste. The boneless chicken was extremely bland and the Hyderabadi chicken tasted like rubber.
For this extremely unsatisfactory meal, we had to pay around 450 rs which was just not worth it.

I ordered Executive Chicken Biryani and Murg Guntur Kebab and it just cost me 167 bucks! Cheap, ain't it?! The best part is the min order they need for home delivery is just Rs. 100. Makes sense to me when you're ordering for only one person. Biryani and Guntur Kabab was delicious, and the Guntur kebab was something new I tasted. I felt the portion was a lil less, I guess I was too hungry. But, hey! I'm not complaining! The biryani costs only 109bucks, worth it! I definitely recommend Ammi's biryani to all the biryani lovers.

  Not so tasty but saves your time when you are looking for something quick.

Since last 4.5 years I have been ordering at Ammi's biryani (at different outlets) when I feel lazy to go out and have food. They do prompt delivery but really tests your patience at times. If you place COD order and don't keep exact change get ready to give some tip to the delivery guy.  And also now they are giving SHARBAT-E-NIMBU in combos which some times will be spilled all over when you the order delivered.

Mostly I ordered Veg Hyderabadi Biryani, Veg Executive Combo and Paratha Combo.
Biryani tasted ok ok. But for the amount you are paying its definitely not worth. Sometimes it tastes too spicy and sometimes no taste at all.  Aloo achari which comes along with their combo is bad at times. I felt spoiled smell and taste. Dessert tasted nice. Parathas and Paneer curries tastes ok ok provided you are quick at eating

  This place being close to my work place was the sole reason i gave it a shot on a late weekday evening. My expectations were low but i guess they should have been rock bottom.

As i entered the place, i was surprised to find noone inside. Not even anyone from the restaurant! A lady peeked from the kitchen and that was a respite and i tried ordering 2 or 3 different type of biryanis, none of which was available. I was told that only one type of biryani was available, it was so forgettable experience that i don't even remember the name, probably it was just a regular chicken biryani.

I was served in quick time, which i guess was the only upside about this place. The taste was bland and i really struggled to find pieces of chicken which seemed to be hidden away in abundance of rice. There was a side undelightful dessert served as well, which was as forgettable as the main course.

  This place is next to the MK ahmed and shiva optical center. I was here to try their biriyani. I was surprised to see no people on a sunday afternoon in their store. I realized that one of the reasons could be the poor ambience and low hygienic conditions in the restaurant. I was unsure whether to have my lunch there or get a takeaway. I however decided its much easier to have it there.
I went for a combo where I got a side, juice and biriyani. I have to say, I liked the biriyani here more than the mani's biriyani.
That said, the place needs to be maintained well to regain any chance of survival. The service was decent here.
My tip is that if you like their biriyani, get a parcel. I've done that the last time and wasn't disappointed.

  Had been a great fan of Ammis biriyani, but lately the food have become pathetic.  The quality have come down to lowest standard over last 1 year period. And i have decided not to order further after my latest order two weeks back.

Ordered one Hyderabdi Murg Biriyani and two murg guntur kabab through phone. The delivery took over 90minutes, even though they promised delivery within 45minutes( it was not on weekend or public holiday).   The food received was worst to the most possible extent. The rice in Biriyani was tasting raw, the chicken was feeling uncooked, and overall the was tasting some bad oil. I hope they have reused the oil endlessely to get this stinking flavour. Even with kabab it was same, bathing in pool of oil( the burned smell of oil was hard to ignore).

I will not order Ammis Biriyani anymore, even my friends have same experience.

They have forgot customers in their zest to grow.

  When you think of eating Biryani, this is one of the definite brand which you will consider before shortlisting the final option. I should say that these is a refurbished branch opened up again in HSR layout. Earlier they were located besides Mcdonalds towards other side and they have reopened it again just besides MK retail near BDA complex. During this gap of 6 months, this was the only brand missing in this area.
There isn't much to talk about the ambience as it is just a tiny place with attached kitchen. For me it didn't look like a restaurant where we can spend sometime and eat properly. So I opted for the take away option and had ordered for normal chicken biryani and executive mutton biryani. Being Sunday I expected that the waiting period might be more than expected but to my surprise they came with the order within 12 min. The container option was real good as it is being served as ready to eat, with spoon and raitha inside it.
Taste wise the biryani didn't taste that much convincingly but shud be OK to ash down our hunger for Biryani. As it is not a service oriented restaurant, so cannot comment much on the service.

Shining star: Murgh Hyderabadi Biryani was yummy and thankfully, the chicken pieces did not put up a struggle i.e. the chicken was well cooked and the gravy that came along enhanced the overall taste really well.

Murgh Harimirch Biryani was also good but a lil spicy for even a chilly lover like me which forced me to gulp down the only sad part of the entire meal, Kheer. It was extremely watery and definitely an embarrassment to the decent biryanis.

Food served after one hour was cold
I specifically asked for extra raita and amazingly they forgot to provide Raita at all
Then I ordered for an Achari aloo, which was not available, so they sent me a chicken tikka roll
Amazing!!!

  I have ordered chicken biriyani from this place which comes in excellent packaging and an eco-friendly carry bag. Since, i was staying up in a student's hostel as a guest for few days, i had no plate or spoon and was worrying about the mess i will create while eating. but thankfully, the biriyani comes in a plastic bowl inside a cardboard box with separate bowls for the curry and the raita and they also provided spoon. the biryani tasted good, like the usual hyderabadi biryani bordering on the spicey type. too much of garam masala, specially the cinnamon was making a bit difficult to gulp after a few spoons. the raita was very good which saved my meal. they gave two big pieces of chicken with it, though i felt small and multiple pieces would have tasted better.

  Used the online ordering feature of Zomato to order dinner from Ammi's biriyani. Ordering on Zomato was quick and easy. So was the order, they delivered in time and did call to confirm the order. That was when I gave instructions which I had missed out to fill whwn placing the order. Executive egg biriyani was well cooked and tasty, but the quantity was less. Wondered what will the regular size be if executive is so less. If you are a light eater or are ordering for a kid, then the quantity suffices. Dum chicken chettinad was finger licking( A little sweet and hot). It came packaged well (they forgot to pack the spoon though) and delivered in time.

  Who doesn't love biriyani !!? And when it is extremely delicious and is a destination for your taste buds, one wants nothing more ! Being an ardent lover of biriyani and a regular customer of Ammi's Biriyani, Kaggasdaspura need no explanations. I have tried out all of their biriyani variety and one thing which makes Ammi's stand out is their ""overloaded flavours"". The flavours go deep inside the dish so that the meat and the rice, both dwell in flavour and spices. My favourite is SPICY ANDHRA CHICKEN BIRIYANI, beware it is truly very spicy and is a pure heaven for Spice lovers. Each biriyani comes with a brinjal curry and minted curd. The minted curd is a trademark of Ammi's. Quality is a win here and so as the quantity. It is generous. Family packs really suffice a family. The packing is compact and no less.

The biryani was very good in taste. It was cooked with traditional basmati rice and I could smell the aroma of biryani as soon as the pack arrived. It was served with raitha and veg.kurma. And 600ml Pepsi was complimentary for family packs.

  This place is located near the SCT college, so not that hard to locate the place.

Ordered food from here a couple of times and to my expectations, it has fallen short of it. The Egg. biryani and Veg. biryani were not cooked properly and not very tasty. It cannot be termed authentic in any way ..can be useful to fill your stomach.

The only point I appreciate is the service delivery of this location. I ordered couple of times and the home delivery has been very good around 30-40mins. The biryani was hot but unfortunately not very tasty.

In terms of kebabs, did not find much either to complain or appreciate, just for filling, that's all.

Overall, If you need a quick service and wanted to have biryani on a urgent basis and were not in a mood for anything else, then go for it !

Ambiance 3/5 nothing much, average.
Taste 3/5 Average

  Good place for the some one desperately craving for authenyic hyderabadi Biriyani..

Ever since I moved to Bangalore from Hyd. I was in search of,some asli hyderabadi Biryani.. And ammis almost touch the spot.

Biryani could be a lil more masaledaar.. The Basmati is good and of premium quality, could be generous with the chicken and mutton pieces..:) And awesome kebans

Note to all hyderabadis in bangalore.. This is not even close to our Paradise or Ruman or Alhamdulillah,, even by a few thousand miles..

  As per its other twigs it also comes with minimal service, decor and ambience... As they have 30+ outlets in Bangalore they are following almost the same recipe for all outlets... Upright with locality... Serving personnel very caring and self-effacing for service... The plating’s are not countless as always... but they use a very well-ordered and decent technique for packaging the takeaway food which I like the most... Their menu is almost nothing for the vegetarians... So not a good choice if you are in lover with veggies...

For ramzan they are running a new menu you can... But my favorite is always the combos... They are good at quantity and quality also... You will not feel like Hyderabad because they are using that much of spice as compared but you will enjoy your biryani because of their balanced recipe not too spicy not too bland. I will say an average biryani...You can try their haleem…

  I ordered Veg Biryani + Achaari Aloo over the phone and was promised delivery within 45 mins. Order number received via SMS can be used on their website to track the order!
Got my order within the promised time (1 pt) and the delivery boy was really polite and had a smile on his face (1 pt).
I was really surprised by the packing, very similar to the pizza boxes. The package had Biryani, Raita, Tomato gravy and a cup of sweet too! Another small packet had a toothpick, tissues and a spoon; really impressed.
The Biryani tasted good with good amount of perfectly cooked vegetables and the achaari Aloo was tangy and I finished both in a jiffy. Quantity is really good for a filling lunch/dinner.

  My general thumb rule is you don't get great veg stuff at places which primarily serve a non veg cuisine . This one is an exception . The Veg biriyanis are good and wholesome . I usually go for their combo which comes with tawa veg and some dessert . Very recently they have upgraded their menu to have more veg options . Another new addition is their executive Biryani which is supposed to be 3/4 the regular quantity but is perfectly enough for a person and fits in within 100 bucks . Do try it - you won't be disappointed .",0,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3,3,1403954913,Ammi's Biryani,HRBR Layout,4,https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/placeholder_200.png,Shyamsundar Srinivasan,https://www.zomato.com/bangalore/ammis-biryani-kalyan-nagar,/static/images/zomato.jpg,/static/images/ammislogo1.png,Bangalore,

  (I presume this is the same Ammi's outlet which is located on the Kasturi Nagar main road.)

I was in Kasturi Nagar area one weekend when I spotted the Ammi's Biryani outlet. Seeing that I was planning to go on ""no-outside-food"" diet starting the very next day (which ended up unsuccessful anyway :P), I got tempted to try some Biryani one last time.

This outlet is like any other of theirs, so I am not going to write about the ambiance and all. My takeaway order was very simple because there are hardly any vegetarian choices. The subz biryani combo is basically 3 packs of biryanis, with a free 1 ltre soft drink thrown in for free. Even after 30 mins post packing, the Biryani was quite hot. Their neat packing of course is something I have always liked. And luckily, this time even the Biryani tasted very good. Made of Basmati rice, it had lots of well cooked veggies such as potato, cauliflower, beans, etc. Even the spice balance was quite right, in that it was neither too spicy nor bland. However, the quantity was too much for three adults. We had to store almost half of the order in the fridge to consume later.

Overall, I was pretty happy with the food which came as a pleasant surprise, given that we've had some not-so-good experiences in the past (when we'd ordered from my office). The meal cost 390 INR which is quite VFM.",1,1,1,3,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,1385550320,Ammi's Biryani,HRBR Layout,4,https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/placeholder_200.png,Manjunath Chikkars,https://www.zomato.com/bangalore/ammis-biryani-kalyan-nagar,/static/images/zomato.jpg,/static/images/ammislogo1.png,Bangalore,

If you want to take some side dish with Biryani starters are good at good price.

  After seeing the new sign quite a few times of the outlet of Ammi's Biryani at Koramangala, I decided to try it. I ordered for a few dishes through home delivery; chicken keema, achari aloo and 4 parathas. Parathas are 25/- each.. a bit costly I feel. They are white colored, layered ones which turn very chewy if kept out for few mins. The achari aloo was for 60/-. Taste was fine. Around 5-6 pieces of wedge shaped potato pieces, with achaar tasting masala. The chicken keema was for 115/-. But came in a small dabba and was salty and had strong garlic flavor.

The taste of the biryani was good. But, I felt that t he quantity was too less compared to other places famous for biryanis. The money you pay, and the quantity of the food you get is somehow not satisfying.
The good part is that along with the biryani, there always comes curry and raita, but, these people give a sweet dish too, that is, phirni or Kheer. Dessert is always a must after a happy meal.

  Ammis started first in Koramangala and which is opposite to Sai Baba Temple.
I remember it was in 2008.. This is near to my previous work place as well.
After noticing so many adds and publicity decided to visit once and went on the same day during the time of dinner.
There was a decent crowd in that outlet and menu is quite decent with Veg and Non Veg Biryanis.
Especially in Veg, they have only Subz Biryani and served with Raitha, Kheer, Gravy, Spoons and Tissue Paper in Beautiful Box.
Honestly being a Spicy food lover i did not liked the masala they use to use. I guess Ammis is the only restaurant to use BRINJAL in Biryani.
Going here is good if you dont have option and the best part is, they have modified the menu by adding lot of starters like Achari Aloo and other dishes too.
Service is really quick and price is affordable with their special offers everyday.

  Writing this review solely based on my one time experience for a home delivery by Ammi's Biryani.

I called them for home delivery to Wilson Garden on a Saturday afternoon to place an order for Egg Biryani. Customer executive asked me if I preferred veg rice or chicken rice for the biryani which was really nice. The order was delivered to me within 30 minutes. The biryani they served was decent enough in quantity and tasted pretty OK. Packaging is really good. It also had a small bowl of sweet.
If you are at home and lazy to get out of the house to eat but want to get something to your doorstep ASAP, then I would suggest you Ammi's Biryani.
Price is decent. Egg biryani costed me 153 Rs. I would not say it was worth the money but considering the fact that not many restaurants give an option of 150 Rs. minimum order for home delivery it was ok.

  I had the worst experience here. I would advice nobody to ever go there. I had ordered an Achari Aloo, it was a take away.
I had traveled for half an hour before opening the parcel and after opening the site was just gross and horrible.
There was a strand of hair in the food and additionally a cockroach which was still alive and moving.
YUCK!!!! It was so disgusting. And when I called the customer care people they were least bothered about it and were acting as though it was an everyday event for them. Later on the manager called me and apologized only after I told him that I would upload it online.
They were really taking everything so lightly that I was shocked. I was also told that they had pest control going on so may be due to that the insect had gotten in the food. The manager did come by to give me a full refund but that doesn't really solve anything or make it ok.

  Being a biryani lover i thought of giving Ammi's a try. I opted for home delivery as the dine in was not very impressive. I must say that they delivered the parcel real quick, and their packaging really made me think WOW!! for a moment. The biryani, pickle, salad, and kheer was very well packed so that they don't spill. But i was depressed when i opened the pack. The biryani was missing its aroma and flavors, even the chicken lacked flavors. For the price that they charge, i think the consumer deserves much more.
I don't think any food lover will try something just because of its packaging, it is the content that matters. As there are many more places offering much better biryani at lower rates.

I would rate this place as:

-Not very tasty biryani

The biryani they serve here is okay. Nothing special about it. Their Hyderabadi biryani is not really 'great'. You'd rather walk some 700 meters and have nice Hyderabadi biryani in Hyderabad house. Their Harimirch biryani is spicy, and worth a try. The one time I ordered mutton biryani, i got rubbery mutton meat. They serve a portion of complementary sweet dish with every plate of biryani. Many reviews of this place on Zomato state that they have really nice packing for delivery, which is true.

  I heard its lots of advertisement on FM radio and thought to try its biryani. Once while passing through kormangala, I stopped there and saw the menu. I decided to take Hyderabadi mutton Dum biryani as I asked for reccommendation which is highly saleable at the outlet. Packing was really impressive. They served hyderabadi mutton dum biryani with raita, salan and one small portion of kheer. Price is also very competitive. Texture wise biryani was awesome. It was really made on dum style of cooking. mutton pieces were three and succullent and flavourful.

  Just ordered 5 executive biryanis.
Supposedly each biryani (130 bucks each) is just abt 340 gms for light eaters. That's light???😏😋.

Ammi's biryani always has good packaging of food.
Coming to the taste: Biryani was quite nice, lightly spiced and had 2 medium pieces of chicken accompanied with spiced raitha.

A good light meal indeed.

The portion of food was indeed satisfying.

  Have ordered from this outlet a few times. The order is taken by a central team and not by a specific outlet. I always mention that I don't need the sweet, it can be substituted by raitha or Salan, last 3 times they have kept the sweet and given extra raitha. one time they gave extra sweet instead of raitha and I had to eat with curds at home.
The quality is not consistent. Sometimes its good, sometimes it is spicy and gives a stomach ache and sometimes it is bland. The Achari Aloo and Tawa vegetable are very oily and spicy and limited options for vegetarians. 
Its nice that they have introduced Executive Biryani to avoid food wastage.

  Never order food from this restaurant, they call it biryani when its just rice with garam masala and a huge piece of chicken. LOL
they dont even know what a biryani is called. The other day i ordered Pindi Cholle biryani, wanted to try veg. I had 2 spoons, thats all, the cholle wasnt even chew-able, had to dump it in the dust-bin, i can get a better veg fried rice with chicken for 90 bucks in street. The cholle were so hard as if they didnt even cook it, the quantity is worst and they charge shitload of money for nothing. And they have this sweet dish , which tastes so weird i felt like puking. Only good thing is the packing. LOL.

  Have tried all their biryanis n desserts.
This time wanted to try something new from the menu.

1. Chicken chettinad:
The price was reasonable, 85 bucks.
But I guess now I know why - 2 of the 3 chicken pieces were something that u won't consider buying or eating! All bones n parts of neck😒!
It was a semi gravy n overpowered with garam masala! I know chettinad cuisine is spicy but this was way over!! So spicy that u can't finish it without gulping down some water or soft drink frequently.
It was still edible n it would go well with nice hot dosas.

2. Aam sharbat (Aam panna):
This came in a nice bottle. This drink is made of raw mango with some spices.

U expect a nice soury or tangy flavor from this juice. Sadly, there was no hint of such flavor. It was sweet, watery n tasted like a light tonic. Had heard so much abt this, but it turned out bad. Was it my bad luck or is this the quality of the drink, only AB will know!

  Wanting to visit this place many times and armed with a very hungry self and husband, I went with the expectation to gorge on a full biryani and boy was I disappointed. Let me tell how and why.
Starting with the fact there was no place one could wash hands, one has to ask for a finger bowl to do so( which is a bowl of hot water and no lime). Addressing the issues other than the taste first. The glasses that were plastic stank. The pepsi we ordered with our meal came after a long time after much reminding.
Coming to the biryani (which no ammi will be proud of). Dry, under-cooked rice, some monstrous gravy passing off as salan and the very watery raita. Also had ordered a starter that was half decent( Guntur murg something). All in all a bad experience. Yet to find a place in Bangalore that will do justice to the "" Hyderabadi Dum biryani"" I have grown up eating in hYderabad.

The food is average and the taste too.

The variety is shown in the menu but they did not have a couple of items that I wished to have.

A chicken biryani that should satisfy one person's hunger costs around 225 INR. Which as per me for the quality and taste is not worth it.

  Ammi's Biriyani is an attempt to become a mass player, in the mould of a Pizza Hut or McDonald's, in the ever burgeoning Biriyani scene of Bangalore.

This outlet is fairly big, neat and with functional interiors that leave you with no doubt that this is a fast-food restaurant chain. The counter, with a large menu displayed behind it, is staffed by a friendly bunch of people, who patiently answered my barrage of questions regarding various items in the menu.

My order being a take-away for one, I decided to keep it simple and hence, ordered a Hyderabadi Chicken Biriyani, although the staff tried to goad me into shelling out ""just Rs.20 more"" (in their words) for a Combo that would've included 2 pieces of Guntur Chicken Kabab as well.

The biriyani came packed in a plastic container along with plastic cups of Raita, Salan and a Meetha. All of these, along with a spoon, a discard box etc, come neatly packed in, literally, a pizza box.

The biriyani, despite it's name, was as un-Hyderabadi as it could get. It wasn't exactly one of those bland ones that we come across in many places but it didn't have that zing of a true Hyderabadi biriyani either. The accompaniments aren't much to speak of either.

Service :- Quick. Home delivery, if required, is for a minimum order of Rs 150.

VFM :- Not great, for the quality, taste etc that one gets.

Verdict :- Recommended ONLY for a one-time try or for lack of better choices. The attempt to be a mass-player, rather than a quality provider, has clearly seeped into their fare.",0,0,1,3,1,3,3,3,1,3,3,1423496658,Ammi's Biryani,Sahakara Nagar,2.5,https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/placeholder_200.png,Anoop Ramakrishnan,https://www.zomato.com/bangalore/ammis-biryani-sahakara-nagar,/static/images/zomato.jpg,/static/images/ammislogo1.png,Bangalore,

they also have home delivery , service is quick & good.

  Home delivery experience!

For the first time i ordered from zomato, as being a regular blogger for their portal took me long time for my first order. :p

So lets come back to the food, i ordered Chicken Seekh kebab and Chicken Keema.

We all order biryani from them so i thought why not bring the experience of side dishes which they offer

Chicken Seekh Kebab were rubbry and didnt tasted well, i felt like i am having chewing gum instead of kebab.the quantity of the kebab was pretty less with small size.

Chicken keema was bad, spices were not blended and weren't cooked properly also, i found a bone in boneless keema. Adding to that the quantity was so so so much less if you want to understand the amount i got it was a small raita bowl which you get while oredring biryani at home.

Not recommended for side dishes.

  This review of Ammi's Biriyani is based on the experience of their Snack Box which was launched a couple of months back. One of the things we all face is the snack time hunger, and a lack of options to order in, or pick up from. Ammi's Snack delivery is an initiative to address this. We got an assorted set of veg and non veg items including their achari aloo roll, chicken keema roll and ammi's special roll along with veg and chicken keema pav. They came in neat packaging like tiffin boxes.

The keema pavs were really good and filling. While the chicken keema was not too spicy, the veg was actually better in this. The achari aloo roll and ammi's special were also pretty different, and quite filling to consume. With chicken roll there are a lot of options, so nothing noteworthy there.

It's a pretty good option to order in at work or even home. Liked their presentation and quantity.

  Scope of Review: Executive Veg Biryani combo: This comes with Biryani and a starter/cool drink.
Review: As a starter, all I got is ""ice cold"" Veg Tawa which is the same masala that you add in biryani + cooked vegetables (Dark brown - definitely a NO-NO to eat as a starter.)
When asked, he re-heated it and re-served it. And once the biryani comes.. I was not surprised to see the same Veg Tawa+Rice = Biryani thing served in my plate, warm.
Recommendations: Only Basmati makes it a Biryani... not just couple of Basmati rice grains along with normal rice doesn't make a Biryani...
Verdict: STAY away if you really want to eat Biryani...

  I went to this place yesterday.It is exactly on on Sarjapur road but on Harlur road.So finding it was little issue.
Small clean place meant more for take away rather than dine in.
We ordered Gosht Hyderabadi Biryani and Murg Hyderabadi Biryani.
Both tasted good and we could find respective flavor in the rice as well.
Not spicy but just right for us.
Overall we loved it and would definately try more of its menu next time.
With Biryani they serve salan , raita and a sweet ( Kheer).
Only thing missing was some Onion salad.
Service was good and they home deliver to far away places as well.

  Tried the Gosht Hyderabadi Biriyani as takeaway.
First thing I noticed was the packaging . It looked like a pizza box , very neat stuff.
On opening , I was surprised seeing each item neatly packed and labeled , with the biriyani , raita , mirchi ka salan and rice kheer for dessert.
There was even an empty container for the bones, and a package with a tissue,spoon and toothpick .
The hot and spicy biriyani was very yummy , and the mirchi salan and raita just added to the flavor. The kheer was just ok, but rounded up the meal nicely.The quantity was also pretty substantial . Overall , we enjoyed our meal and looking forward to trying the other items on the menu .

  I had never tried the food at this biryani chain before and was presently surprised. They make such great biryani! We had Mutton Keema and regular mutton biryani(Hyderabadi) along with chicken kabab for sides. The Biryani was consistently spicy and flavored just what you would expect from the Hyderabadi Dum variety. The chicken kabab was boneless mini chicken pieces in semi dry mint/pepper masala and perfectly compliments the biryani if you look for a spicier meal. I would compare the quality here to any other good biryani in town(Richie's, Meghana's, Lazeez etc.) and they certainly combine it with good overall packaging and friendly service in dine in. Highly recommended.

  I think the main reason Ammi's Biryani survive is because there are no other major biryani restaurants who do such wider home delivery across bangalore like they do and have so many outlets. Unfortunately with all required infrastructure in place , their quality of food leaves a lot to be desired.

When they had launched the Thalassery Biryani , I ordered it once and it was really good. I was impressed so much that I ordered it again and then it turned out to be horrible. Ghee, Masala all were uneven and it even seemed not freshly made the same day. After that terrible experience, I have not tried Ammi's biryani again.

  Have made home delivery orders twice from this place and I have to say I had a really good experience with respect to their packaging - Everything packed neatly in separate sealed containers, a small use and throw cardboard trash can, a plastic sipper for the juice, etc.

The Executive Biriyani combos are compact and is a good option for a meal for 1 rather than going for a Biriyani as such. I tried the Murgh executive biriyani combo in which the Murgh chicken was extremely oily (Management, please look into this) and the biriyani was good, though not great.

  Coming from Kerala, I hopped in for a quick spicy hyderabadi biriyani. The service was prompt. Served me in 2.5 minutes. However the food was way below average.
Firstly the rice was bland, the chicken was lifeless and for something that was named 'hyderabadi', it did not have any authenticity. The salad was mere water and yoghurt.
Overall, one of the worst biriyanis I have ever encountered.
And to make things worse, there were a lot of insects on the floor. So thumbs down on the hygiene part too.
Avoid the place, unless desperate.

  Though biriyani is not one of the dishes I look forward to, I still ordered for a home delivery for a chicken biriyani and kebab from Ammi’s. They are prompt in taking the order and the delivery was also well in time. The packing was nicely done. You get raita, salan and a sweet along with the biriyani. The biriyani tasted good but the sweet was very average. The kebabs were too spicy and oily. You will get the taste of mostly the black peppers and nutmeg. It’s taste was just average. Can be tried once if you are a biriyani lover.

  Needs to buck up.

This place used to be good an year back.
But now it is not the best place to order from.
The chicken biryani's rice was not well cooked and had excessive masala in one portion rendering that portion inedible.
The chicken was not great either as it was partially uncooked.

I would definitely think again before ordering from here, hereafter.

  Ammi Biryani , it seems has lost all its charm and reputation of being one of the best Biryani options in Bangalore over the period of time.

Though they have advanced technologically, but the quality of food has gone down drastically.
The essence of biryani seems to be nowhere found in its biryani.

My pick from its menu used to be Zeera Samba and Hyderabadi style Chicken and Muttion Biryani earlier.
But now when we ordered from here, it was a utter disappointment and a personal loss of face for me as I suggested it to my team mates.

The biryani rice lacked the chicken / mutton flavored juice and the portioning was not up to the mark.

I would never order nor recommend this biryani to any one in future.

  Ammi's biryani was yet another stop in my quest to eat the best Chicken Biryani that Bangalore has to offer.

It was moderately surprising that I haven't ever noticed this chain of restaurants despite their decent presence across the city.

So, on a weekday for lunch I tried their chicken combo which had chicken biryani, mirch ka salan, onion raitha, chicken starters and a gravy (from as much as i can remember). Their chicken biryani was fairly good. It's definitely worth trying and value for money if you're looking to try a different option for your work lunch.

  I ordered a Gosht Hyderabadi Biriyani which came with 3 pcs of mutton, biriyani (basmati), raita, mirchi ka salan & meetha (kheer). The bill was Rs 201/- all inclusive.

The mutton biryani was one of the best I had in Bangalore till date. Rice was rightly spiced and the meat just fell off the bones. I didn't like the mirchi ka salan but that does not mean that you won't. I was expecting the salan to have some pepper which was missing and actually tasted a bit odd. Kheer was ok and raita quantity was pretty less.

The packaging was excellent. I am thinking about ordering the same as office lunch someday.

  Ammi's biryani is a ubiquitous brand in Bangalore but I hadn't been to one before tonight. We ordered a chicken tikka biryani and an achari aloo roll (for the lack of availability of other veg options). The biryani was good in quantity and the taste was really good.

But tough luck today in terms of my selection.
It was Chicken Hyderabadi Biryani, name matters a lot. While ordering itself, your mouth will fill with waters but here is the real story.
Packing was really good, I opened the pack, waooooo, flavoured Biryani rice, muahhhh.
But WTF with chicken. It was not at all from Biryani. They kept chicken pieces from some other menu, like chicken curry or something else. Here I lost my faith in #Ammi. Sorry for such review but you know Truth is the real pain.

The biryanis were too good especially the mutton and yes, we also ordered for Chatpata chicken which too did justice to its name although being a tad bit heavier on the sweeter part. Nevertheless, my taste buds seemed happy!

The major disappointment were the desserts. The phirni had too much of rose essence and totally diverted from how an actual phirni should taste like. Gulaab jamuns were not great at all.

  Jab hungry, Kuch acha khao!

A place has always scored 5 in my list for its lightning fast delivery. You order, sit back. Before you relax, have your Biriyanis delivered at your door step. They bring Biriyani hot n neatly packed. I never used an extra plate or spoon. Perfect for eat n throw. Biriyani has always been good n tasty. Raitha won't be great though. Salan n sweet are kinda okay. I love their chicken kebab boneless. I however do not like their other kebab varieties. They would be too oily to eat. Their executive combo Biriyanis are a real bet for the value. Can give it a try.

Have also tried dine in. The place would be empty always. They're more focused on door deliveries.

  Review based on home delivery.We use to order for home delivery almost every week.We tried various combos and kabebs.The parcel was very good and highly professional.Biriyani and kebebs was of OK kind and not great compared to other biriyani places but considering home delivery,no complaints. But recently they started to cut down the quantity.Previously 1 biriyani was sufficient for two people but now 1 was not sufficient for one person.Along with that they cut down dessert,gravy,raitha that used to come with combo packs.So we stopped ordering from Ammi's.

Unusual because, their is nothing about this place which I liked even a tad bit.

First of all, there are not enough chairs and tables to sit and eat in peace. And this is the problem in almost all their outlets.

The staff is also not anywhere near cooperating and are have absolutely no clue which box of parcel packet contains what or whether which one's ven/non-veg etc.

I dont understand the hype about it. Probably because its just about everywhere like a CCD outlet.

Also for the money they charge the taste is also not that great. Its best not to parcel, as the cold food makes it even worse.

  the executive chicken biriyani was OK in taste nothing special but I would prefer any day biriyani pot. the price is reasonable but the amount of rice that you get is very less. the pieces ate also small. in executive biriyani you get a choice of chicken kofta or chicken kabab or soft drinks.

  My God!!! Horrible delivery experience. You won't believe guys I waited for my lunch almost for 3 hours. My brother wasn't well and I specially mentioned as soon as possible and I was at work and I placed at 2.00p.m. first of all they sent wrong parcel and when we asked for replacement delivery boy told he will be back in 30mins. After that for 2 hours I called up CC and followed up. And they were giving me false info saying boy tried reaching but we didn't pick up. Such a big lie. Though we are regular customer they are doing one or the other mistake in delivery. This is not the for first time , it had happened 4-5 times. They commit mistake in every order. Before sending they won't check at all. And over that full false information. I really wanna suggest you guys don't go for this.

  Home Delivery order # 161470, Bill#207613 ordered on 17th September 2016 at my residence. The order had Executive Chicken Biryani and Chicken Tikka. While tikka tasted just fine, the Biryani box was very distasteful of a Biryani. It was just a box full of burnt onions, some white rice and 2 piece of chicken. I had also requested that i dont want biryani with chicken leg piece on it. Oddly enough, the biryani delivered was with leg piece and very bitter of burnt onions. No flavour, no taste of the regular Ammis Biryani that I had known till this date.  Not to mention, there was no complimentary raita (a must with biryani)  too!

  I place an order at 9:08PM on a rainy night. I get a response that the order will be delivered before 10:03PM. I call at 9:36PM to reconfirm and I’m informed that the food is ready and packed and will be out for delivery in 10 minutes. I call back at 10:04PM and I’m informed that the delivery boy will be at my doorstep in 10 minutes.

At 10:30PM I get a call from someone at the restaurant that they can’t deliver my order.

with it's unique packing concept and some lip smacking Biryani's all they need is to provide more options to pick from the menu. The rates are reasonable and not much dine in experience.

Taste: 4 Appreciated by all as not too spicy or too mild, though I find a little lacking in flavor. The raita for some was a little sour. For me it was good. The kheer v good as usual.

Delivery: 1
Took more than 95minutes for delivery! A 200% deviation from the 45mins SLA. Apart from hiring location knowledgeable individuals, there should be an effort to actually notedown/ remember the address and not call for almost every turn.

Quality: Good, masala in biryani was a bit oily, but rest all were good in quality. Food was warm but not hot, so not really complaining here as this is a delivery issue

  Ammi's was one of the first biryani houses we used to order from while in IIM campus, and thus the place set the benchmarks for Bangalore Biryani. What we didnt realize until much later was that there were several other biryani places nearby which were much better than Ammi's, be it the quality of the rice, the freshness of the meat and even the taste and quantity of condiments that come along with them. The only pro of Ammi's was their packaging, which came in ready-to-eat box with all the stuff neatly compartmentalized; a boon for hostel students. But then, who minds eating in paper plates without spoons if the food itself is better.

  I've ordered from Ammi's before. Their food is usually good. But last week when I ordered sabzji biryani from Ammi's, I was really taken aback. Not only was the order delivered to me after 1.5 hrs, the food was cold and the biryani rice had shrunk and tasted like raw rice. I refused to pay the delivery guy the amount because of their much touted ""45 minutes or free"" guarantee. He started giving excuses like the place is new to him, the address was not proper etc etc. I called up the outlet and all I received was a ""sorry sir"". I'm not sure what to do with the sorry, maybe make a poster out of it and hang it in my drawing room.

  Well here is an example of restaurent which is able to survive 6 years with opening branches just because of publicity and no quality.
To serve biryani,one should have sense of biryani, the curry served here is strangely a tomato curry which doesnt go well with the biryani,they could have tried a mirchi ka salan like other major biryani restaurents do.
Secondly, they have a centralized kitchen, you will get biryani prepared in morning , heated and given to you.

  Dear Team at Ammis,

1. Your biryani is wonderful, I for years always though Hyderabad for Biryani or no where else. You guys are proving me wrong. I honestly think you guys are doing a good job and should keep up the good work.

2. Your portions can be up'd a little bit, a good sized eater like me, felt insufficient....

3. Salan needs to worked just a little bit..nothin dramatic just a tad bit
3.a. thicken your raita a bit as well

4. Over all good job, good service and prompt response on the helpline, for once some one in 3 years could spell my building name...thumbs up and a happy dance.....

I ordered twice today and yes it comes from my heart....Burp and good luck

From a farmer to a start up

Regards,

Happy farmer",1,1,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1380207721,Ammi's Biryani,BTM Layout,4.5,https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/user_avatars/wine_2x.png?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A,Swamyboo Nameet,https://www.zomato.com/bangalore/ammis-biryani-bannerghatta-road,/static/images/zomato.jpg,/static/images/ammislogo1.png,Bangalore,

  Tried many Biryani's.

We (me and my colleague) went there for having the Biryani as we keep seeing their two wheeler moving around. So, ordered two Chicken Biryani.

Ambiance :- Good. You wont feel that you are sitting very near to a busy road. Just opposite to Gopalan Mall.

Food :- It is tasty. If you are hungry, I do not think a single biryani will fill your stomach. The quantity is less compared to other Biryanis in this area. I think they are not cooking/making biryanis from there. They shift to a plate from a different container. May be they may not be having cooks/no provision to cook there?

I would say, visit when you have very low appetite. Or order few other dishes as well.

Hope they improve the quantity like the quality they provide.
Chicken pieces were tender and tasty.

  Punch Line:
Good Quantity, Very Hot Masala Curry, Well Packed Delivery of Order, Need to work on the curry's taste a bit more.

This place is nearby and we happen to order a lot from here. The Biryani is prepared good but is too spicy. Also the Chutney or Curry that is given is not so good at one gets at other places. It tastes a bit sour and I usually avoid it.

It's worth a try and see for yourself if you like it.

No one called me to inform about the delay. I called more than 15-20 times. Everytime I was told by the staff they will call back in 5 min and that 5 min never ended.I took the manager's number and called him to hear back an apology and that he would check and call back ASAP. After 10 min I had to call him to realize that the phone was made unreachable. Mr Naredra was the Manager.After waiting endlessly at last the delivery boy came just before 5 pm and I refused to pay the amount as per the norms that if the order is not delivered in one hour, its free of cost. The delivery boy pleaded that it will be deducted from his salary and at the end I had to pay for the terrible service as well.What a day.I just have to tell that they lost one customer and I will make sure the terrible service is spread to everyone I know.Giving poor rating and not awful as rest of the times, they have served on time.

The speaker on call was quick n sweet enough to take down n give me enough info. The chicken biryani was spicy enough for this andhra  palate. Delivered within 30 mins and packing was impressive. Well packed in small neat containers and desert was something i din expect. Thumbs up from me n would surely return.

											   I ordered a chicken biryani from RT nagar branch and I found the BILL inside the food container. I laughed and threw it away. Then I saw 2 cockroaches in the food. I took it back and threw it in front of them. But unfortunately there is no department of food sanitation in this country so I can't try and shut it down.

											   I had been looking forward to visit this place, as i had passed by this location many times on my way to work, and so i did, on the night of 29th December 2010.I expected the place to have some of the best biriyanis, as they mainly specialize and serve only biriyanis and a few kebabs..:pbut i was shocked to taste some of the worst food that i have had my entire life...I visited the place with one of my friend, we both ordered a chicken biriyani each and a plate of chicken kebab, the service was quite prompt(guess everything was ready and the food was just heated as this place mainly deals in home deliveries) the portions looked quite filling, but the main deal starts when u taste a spoonful of the biriyani. The rice was quite dry and there was hardly any chicken in the biriyani. It lacked the basics of flavour, salt and even spice, frankly it was one of the really bad things i had ever eaten.Then things got worse when the kebabs had arrived, in front of us were lying 4 small morsels of what was once called a kebab. The taste was more pathetic, i felt they were made in the morning itself and they had also forgotten to reheat it. I would suggest them to either close down, or change their approach to the way things are done, or else they would have to close shop for good. And I would suggest that nobody goes there and neither places any order from there, you would be better off eating and any other small Mess or darshini than to waste your time, money and ruin your health by eating at such a place.

											   Today I ordered from Ammi's biryani for the first time through their call centre and I experienced the worst home delivery service ever.They said it would take 70 minutes for the food to be delivered and it took 2 hours to do the same. In between I had to call their call centre 6-7 times. I ordered lunch and was served evening snacks. They did not even had the courtesy to call me in between if the order was getting delayed. Moreover, I feel that 70 min itself is too long to deliver food within 2.5 KM. The food was delivered cold, but the biryani tasted good.I have never experienced such inefficiency in home delivery.I will give 3 stars for the food but 1 star for the service.

I am a die hard biriyani fan and it is difficult to displease me with a biriyani , but they have even managed to do that :-)

No it hasntIf you wish to buy a nice pashmina swalyou look for discounted price of a swal and not of a street side handkerchief Basically Ammis Biryani is no BiryaniSo all what you pay in the name of Biryani is something that can only fill up your stomach. These guys came out with a deal in Snapdeal Chicken Kabab + Chicken Biryani + Coke worth Rs 150/-  Good! But then after reading the reviews here I understood that eating here is going to become an assignmentand thank God! The package had a Coke and that cannot be screwed up Yesterday evening I went thereKabab: I ordered for a boneless onethey delivered one with boneupon questioning they replied Not Availablewell it was 8:45 evening! The quality was no better than what you get on street side @Rs15-20/100grms!Biryani: Same horrible qualitythe worst I have ever had in my lifetime! Even those you get in local Bars are better than what you get hereCoke: Even they managed to screw this up as well Shamelessly they served me a warm Coke!Need I mention anything else?

											   This is with reference to my visit to Ammi's Biriyani Outlet,74-12 LIC Colony, Sector 11, Koodihalli Village, Jeevan Bhima Nagar, Bangalore.Today,7th Sep 2013,I visited the above outlet of Ammi's Biriyani and this complaint is on the basis of the bitter experience from same.We ordered for Mutton combo Biriyani(260) and Gosht Hyderabadi Biriyani (200). First when the bill came, we were charged for one more Pepsi(40), which comes free with the combo. Later, the cost of pepsi was discounted based on the discussion with the waiter.We visited the outlet ,based on the offer in which they mentioned free biryani for orders between 4 pm-6.30 pm along with any two biriyanis.We ordered for two biryanis which costed total of Rs 485, but we were not given the free biriyani. We spoke to the store manager, Narayanan about the same and other staff and mentioned that we were not happy about same. He spoke to someone, whom he mentions as his manager and came back to us stating that this offer was only from Mon-Fri and today was Saturday and this offer is not valid, which really disappointed us from a reputed firm.We went through the advertisement  which was placed there,wherein nowhere it was mentioned that the offer was valid only during weekdays.We asked to write and confirm on the bill which they refused. Now,I am looking forward for a compensation from the company considering the fact that I wasted coming from M.G Road to Jeevan Bhima Nagar in car,which includes the petrol charge and also value of my time, as the company promotes false commitments and offers to customers.Kindly note there was no * mentioning conditions apply.Details of BillTIN no .29470614588Type:DinningOrder no 145657Bill no 220198Date 07/09/2013Table no 6Expecting the reply asap.

											   Okayish Biriyani, but you won't mind having a plate when you're hungry and lazy at the same time. They do deliver at your door, however the delivery is not very prompt. I have ordered more than twice, and they have managed to take more than an hour every time. The Chicken Kebab they serve is not really a Kebab but some chicken chunks in thick greenish gravy, which actually goes decently well with the Biriyani.The best part is that it is very cheap. I wouldn't expect city's best Biriyani at this price. Definitely worth a try, but not really for the Biriyani purists.

											   I decided to give Ammi's biryani a try today. I ordered a of Hyderabadi Gosht Biryani and Hyderabadi Keema biryani. The guy quickly called me up and told me that they don't have any of the fancy items on the menu but just 1 type of Hyderabadi Gosht Biryani.So I decided to order one family pack of the Hyderabadi Gosht Biryani.The guy took 1 hour 30 minutes to reach my home. And charged me Rs 534Despite being the family pack, the guy packed only 1 portion of Raita, Gravy and sweet. The taste of biryani was between bad and average. the rice was burnt, the mutton was hard and chewy and with no marination or spice.All in all it was a long wait and a horrible experience ... will never order again from these guys.

											   Horrible biryani and curry..

I had the biryani last week in my Paying guest accomodation near to this venue.

First time , I am trying this biryani.

Reasons- 

Biryani flavours are not in proportion and loads of oil floated with oil. Felt like had 500gms of empty ch

Raitha has a terrible stink and onions & curds were not fresh enough.

Gravy for sides are terrible, it tasted burnt with more hint of garlic and nothing else not a bite of onions or tomatoes.. soaked with oil OF COURSE

My first experience is worst. after placing the order have waited to 1 hour without any response. when i called them to check on the order there comes the highlight order was not even placed. What they claim as 45 min delivery or your food is free is all cheating the customer. they were ready to provide the food with 20% discount BUT not for what i have ordered. NOT sure what happened to their claim in papers. it will be their choice. reason behind is sunday. Oh god great to know that these bunch of jokers have found out today is sunday. my initial call was at 12:15 PM. I am not sure whether we have to place the order a day prior.

  Ammi's Biriani comes in a beautiful box containing the Biryani along with Raita and Curry. The delivery is on time and clean. Food are packed in a spill proof container. However, the presentation doesn't match upto the taste. The box of food we got delivered had Biriyani, which tested being cooked by a novice than an expert chef. It's hard to make out which style of Biriyani it was. It lacked the aroma and taste of spices, with the chicken pieces being overcooked to feel like a hard rock. The Raita had very bad quality Curd, which cannot be ingested. However, the food were better in quality and quantity during dine-in than delivery.

  Ammis biriyani.. Was one of my favorite before.
Hoping it would be the same..I ordered a mutton biriyani and gulab jamoon last afternoon ... And I was disappointed for the following reasons
1. The food arrived late by 30 minutes.
2.Food portions were small for the price paid
3.The pieces were soaked in a gravy which was overpowered by the pungent dry spice mixture..
4.I was looking for a the jeera samba option but not available .
5.Raita was very watery.
6.The gravy in the meat was more than the rice served..

This cold Friday night I have called them to deliver me a gosht hyderabadi Biriyani and they delivered to me before time. The aroma of Biriyani just blown me away the very moment I opened the box. Nice flakes of fried onions with cilantro leafs on nicely marinated and colored basmati rice is sufficient enough to water your mouth. Then comes the show stopper gosht pieces, I was amused to see 5 pieces of big sized meat in the plate. Nicely cooked soft tender and smelling really amazing piece of meat.

Had rated 3+ in my last review but have turned it down bcos of their reckless behavior.

Had ordered executive biriyani and Achari chicken at 7.30 pm and it reached my house at 9.30 pm after going to a wrong address. Food was not hot and it was complete waste of money. No one took responsibility and as a customer I have to pay the entire cost for eating something that wasn't worth. Feeling sick 😡

Wanted a quick dinner so went ahead with Ammis last night. Took an executive chicken biriyani (costed INR 112) through Zomato. Came Neatly packed and delivered by a last mile delivery service.

 When we asked, they replied food is getting prepared. Once we get the order, here comes the actual story. food was bad, as if it was prepared in the morning just they just baked it again.

Having tried the biriyani out already once at one of its other branches and liked it, I gave it another go only to be disappointed this time. The spices had formed lumps and did not mix evenly in the rice making the already overspiced biriyani inedible. Raita was watery.

  Worst service and worst biryani. My wife had ordered the biryani and kabab from them two weeks ago.

The order was placed via food panda. The delivery took 2.5 hours in afternoon and that too after multiple arguments and repeated calls to their call centre and managers of Ammis biryani outlets. They kept on issuing different order no with different outlet for delivery and no one had any clue. It went from marathalli, varthur and back to Marathalli. It was test of patience for my kid who was waiting to taste the food.

Finally food arrives and guess what. Cold biryani with no taste and highly spiced. Kabab looked like coming from frozen chamber. Will never order and food from Ammi's biryani.

  Thanks to my roommate, I tried this biryani a couple of times when I was new in Bangalore. Of course, I didn't to try it again after those two attempts. 

Talking about the biryani, they don't seem to use basmati variety, rather it's a very ordinary quality rice. Chicken pieces were dry, nowhere close to what you get in a biryani, they weren't undercooked though. The rice lacked any biryani flavour and spices. We ordered for home delivery and fortunately (or rather unfortunately) they didn't do a blunder there. 

Advice - Don't go by the cover photograph they've put up in this page, this biryani is a definite miss if you're in Bangalore. All those marketing stints don't ensure a good biryani. I'm not sure if this is 1.0 or 2.0, but I don't want to try it once more just for that.

I ordered biryani here and was quite shocked with the quantity they provided as any primary school kid will still be hungry after having the biryani.

1.Its not a hyderabad biryani 
2.Its more of a home made biryani which you will get in most of your Muslim friends home.
3.The gravy and raitha for the biryani was so thin like water with no taste.
4.The rice and chicken pieces were cold and stale.

  It was by far the worst Dinner/biryani experience I have had in my life. We had ordered 2 Executive Veg Biryani and one Chicken Family pack. We opened the Beg Biryani and it was competely spoiled with a bad odour coming from it. We called the store and got it replaced after a while we opened the Chicken biryani and even that turned out to be bad. We could not do anything as it was already well past 12 in the night.

One the money spent on the biryani turned out to be completely waste and on top of that the time wasted and the overall experience was pathetic.

If you cant serve good and healthy food dont open stores in every nook and corner of the city.

  Had Hyderabadi biryani two times.. 1st time a dine-in and 2nd time take-away, both the time I think that the quantity of the rice is a bit less. Thanks to ammi's that they accept sodexo coupons where on buying 2 I got another one for free, so that it satisfied for two person.
Hence if you are a foodie then with one plate is might not enough for you. And I think that ammi's will be looking to it and increase the quantity a bit more.

  Truth is i struggle to provide feedback and here is why. Tried the hydrabadi mutton biryani, it was more like ghee rice, hardly a piece of flesh in the order and you had to dig through the whole aluminium plate to dig this one out. So you recognise the predicament, while the rice was good basmati and had nice smell. The flavour was average and mildly spiced.

The box is also contains watery raita, mirchi ka salan and kheer, Frankly was not palatable.

Do not get fooled by their menu card which reads 150/- for the chicken biryani,they charge another 35/- as tax.So a total of 185/- is simply not worth it.
The biryani itself is tasteless.The rice and chicken pieces are dry and the color itself looks awkward and it was dead cold,atleast they could have heated it before handing it over.",2,2,3,3,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,1373894845,Ammi's Biryani,Marathahalli,1.5,https://b.zmtcdn.com/images/user_avatars/wine_2x.png?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A,Sandeep Reddy,https://www.zomato.com/bangalore/ammis-biryani-marathahalli,/static/images/zomato.jpg,/static/images/ammislogo1.png,Bangalore,

  tastier biriyani's are available in the city..... the biriyani here is just average...tastes artificial....
And dont even get me to the starters.. half of them tastes refrigerated and no flavor..... i suggest to keep this place as an last option if you are in a mood to eat a sumptuous dinner or lunch..

on the other hand.. their style of take aways are really good.. they pack it pizza like boxes which are ergonomically good and easy to take away and stays hot for long.. that is one positive aspect....",2,2,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,1369803617,Ammi's Biryani,Marathahalli,2,https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/53e/da970a89890ade5dad9b144a5cc5b53e.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A,Deepu Selvaraj,https://www.zomato.com/bangalore/ammis-biryani-marathahalli,/static/images/zomato.jpg,/static/images/ammislogo1.png,Bangalore,

  I'm not that good fan of biryani. However for our team celebration we have decided to order food from Ammi's. It was nicly packed. However only non veg biryani turned out to be good and veg biryani was not at all good. I hate it actually. Not sure how they have prepared it.

If you planning to have veg biryani.. its not the right place for sure.

Mutton & chicken biryani is fine. Moreover they wont accept credit cards that was also a big disappointment for me. Our bill was aronnd 8k and we had to pay cash. I think they should start accepting the credit cards for home delivery. It would a good trun out for them as well.

  Ammi's Biryani is good for delivery. Their packaging is very neat, in a pizza-like box with plastic fork, spoon and all inside. If you are ordering from workplace its very convenient because you dont have to go through the hassle of cutting silver foils and raita packets. Taste wise the Biryani is not spicy like Hyd or Andhra style biryani; it is mildly spiced and flavored, which is the way I like it. If you have eaten Biryani at Lazeez, that's the closest I can compare to explain the spice factor. The portions are not great, and if you are used to eating huge portions from places like Biryani zone or even Nandini, it may not fill your tummy. The complementary phirni is a nice touch which I like. Cost wise some may find it a little expensive, especially the starters and small portions of Biryani, but I dont mind it much coz of the packing!",0,0,3,3,3,0,1,3,3,3,3,1350375268,Ammi's Biryani,Marathahalli,3,https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/84f/5d630ec83ba1c45060fc371b7b45284f.jpg?fit=around%7C100%3A100&crop=100%3A100%3B%2A%2C%2A,Manjunath Chikkars,https://www.zomato.com/bangalore/ammis-biryani-marathahalli,/static/images/zomato.jpg,/static/images/ammislogo1.png,Bangalore,

  Decent Biryani in awesome packing!

I was looking for Biryani home delivery and found this place on Zomato. The minimum order was 250rs for delivery near Kundanahalli gate . I was skeptical about the time of delivery and taste initially. But to my surprise they delivered in 30min. That's probably because I placed my order at 6:30pm.

The packing was brilliant done! I totally loved it. The box was like a pizza box with biryani and other 3 gravies (raita, payasam and biryani gravy) in 3 small separate cups. Coming to the taste, the biryani was OKish. The quantity was enough for one. I ordered a Murg kabab too but it turned out to nothing like I expected. It wasn't that great.

  They create a lot of hype with the advertising and the name. One would think that you would get a decent biryani at least (we were not hoping for mouth watering biryanis) given the fact that it is just a takeaway / delivery joint. The quality of the biryani that was delivered was pathetic - a couple of pieces of chicken and mutton (in the respective biryanis) along with rather bland rice - very little or no masala in it.

GoogleReview,The Biriyani was fine! And a little different from typical Hyderabadi Biriyani but then every place has its own recipe. I would prefer Hyderabadi Biriyani over this. Also when I ordered for Egg Biriyani the person at the reception took my order saying that's the last one only to cancel it after 5mins. saying it's been already ordered. The staff was not as active as it should be and the reception guy when when was not well articulated as well. To try a different flavor of Biriyani you can give a shot.,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,1471590341,Ammi's Biryani,BTM Layout,3,https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bfPLS8EgI8A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA2c/ZxGmsqp9JFg/photo.jpg?sz=40,Ankur Parihar,https://www.google.co.in/?gfe_rd=cr&ei=r975WIeGN--K8Qf38IGoAw#q=ammis+biryani+btm,/static/images/google.jpg,/static/images/ammislogo1.png,Bangalore,

GoogleReview,"Easily visible from the main road, this very small place serves mainly biryani. Executive chicken biryani weighing 350 grams with 2 pieces, is good enough, with great packaging. 

Chicken Tikka boneless is 155 for large pack. Mutton Biryani 235, executive Chicken Biryani 129. That's good enough for me. Taste is not bad, but good. It's not awesome, but really good. They serve a very liquidised chutney, which should carry a rating of 0. For a fast, cheap, decent enough grub, I really like this... 4.5 out of 5, never 5

There must be around 5 tables with 4 plastic chairs each. The place must be the size of my home's living room- that small..! Nice humble boys serving, esp. Prakash... 

I have observed that most people get their items packed, and have them at home. They don't prefer to eat here, sitting on the table. So I guess they're famous for takeaways, and online ordering, especially for small families on tight budget, or for bachelors. If you want to carry them home, do remember to carry your own carry bag, or you will be charged Rs. 20 extra. 

On the menu what price you see, it's the same price you are charged. That's one thing I like very much. The price mentioned is all-inclusive, including taxes. So no extra charges. 

When I purchased food here, I met a British lady, a resident of the local area with her children. She ordered Biryani here, and said she's a regular here. She said it's less spicy here, and very tasty.

GoogleReview,"As per its other twigs it also comes with minimal service, decor and ambience... As they have 30+ outlets in Bangalore they are following almost the same recipe for all outlets... Upright with locality... Serving personnel very caring and self-effacing for service... The plating’s are not countless as always... but they use a very well-ordered and decent technique for packaging the takeaway food which I like the most... Their menu is almost nothing for the vegetarians... So not a good choice if you are in lover with veggies...

For ramzan they are running a new menu you can... But my favorite is always the combos... They are good at quantity and quality also... You will not feel like Hyderabad because they are using that much of spice as compared but you will enjoy your biryani because of their balanced recipe not too spicy not too bland. I will say an average biryani...You can try their haleem…

GoogleReview,"THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I HAD BIRIYANI FROM AMMIS AND SURELY WOULD DISSUADE ANYONE FROM HAVING THE SAME.

Reason : 
I have been ordering Biriyani from Ammis for the last few years. Had no issues.
Taking this experience ahead, for the new years eve party with friends, i volunteered to arrange for biriyani.
I ordered 2 party packs of Chicken biryani and 1 family pack of Veg biriyani. Had requested delivery promptly at 6:00pm as requested.
We took the food and went to my friends place for the party.
At around 8:30pm, the children had the biriyani and said it did not taste like the regular ammi's biriyani. with so much of partying we did not pay much heed, until the adults sat for dinner. To my horror and that of the 15 hungry friends, both, the veg and chicken biriyani was spoilt. This was extremely embarasing. I logged in a response call with the number provided by SMS that i am unhappy with the delivery and got a sms saying that someone will call me the next day. They did, but other than the usual sorry, there was no remorse. I asked for a call to be arranged with someone senior. They said they would arrange a call back, which never happened. The next day again i called the call centre and had the same request . Again the same promise that someone would call back. Never happened.

THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I HAD BIRIYANI FROM AMMIS AND SURELY WOULD DISSUADE ANYONE FROM HAVING THE SAME.",2,2,3,3,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,1484810640,Ammi's Biryani,Indiranagar,1,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bKZB-uKY5gI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AMcAYi_oEnqRD8qmcMpfYZRRbcfrVZ6DPg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=40,Sarangan Soundararajan,https://www.google.co.in/search?espv=2&q=ammis+biryani+indiranagar&oq=ammis+biryani+indiranagar,/static/images/google.jpg,/static/images/ammislogo1.png,Bangalore,

GoogleReview,I wonder why people like such kind of biriyani! There's nothing tasty in it and I'm afraid to taste those chicken pieces again. Purely nonsense it would be if one goes for this restaurant twice. I have given 2 stars because of the manger's generosity. I had ordered for chicken kheema biriyani which I found sour as vinegar. I asked manager about it n he accepted my complaint and pleaded to order for another one. And then I ordered for hyderabadi biriyani which I found tasteless too.,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,3,1,3,3,1484809316,Ammi's Biryani,Koramangala,2,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BFUYvZvbiP8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAARo/d2dy_i5IGZM/photo.jpg?sz=40,suraj javalli,https://www.google.co.in/search?espv=2&q=ammis+biryani+Kaggadasapura,/static/images/google.jpg,/static/images/ammislogo1.png,Bangalore,

ordered hyderabadi biryani (mutton & chicken) along with Jal jeera & later Kheer (Phirni)
Mutton biryani: It wasn't a Hyderabadi biryani the appearance was bad meat was al mostly blackened & taste was average.
upon asking the crew (staff) said this is Bangalore type hyderabadi taste...This surprised me a lot because Hyderabadi will remain same disregards of place.
Though chicken biryani was little better than the mutton but that wasn't to the mark.
The aroma of spices was missing the meat was not marinated properly etc.
Jal Jeera was not at all Jal Jeera
Kheer (phirni) was...I don't know what it was.
I don't recommend this place for North Indian people who are taste freak

TripAdvisor,"A pretty good option if you want to order a decent biryani for delivery. They are all over the place in Bangalore. In Electronic City itself I have seen at least three branches - so I don't know where my food is coming from.
I have been trying them for close to a year (there are very few other places that do home delivery in this part of town). The food has been consistent for the most part - if you order late in the day (lunch or dinner) you are likely to get a little cold food and not as fresh as it should be - you know what they call the bottom of the pot variety. The Hyderabadi Biryani is good the Jeera Sambhar similarly so but the best has to be their Shaadi Biryani a.k.a. Virindhu Biryani. I must add that they are a little miserly with their raitha and salan. The rice pudding they give is OK but if you try their matka phirni - beware it is a little addictive.

They have many outlets in bangalore but I think outs was Richmond town outlet which seemed to be more of a take away. The place was clean and
we eat there itself.
Ordered 2 hyderabadi combos and soft drinks.....each combo had a good portion of hyderabadi chicken biryaani2 kabaabscurd and a rice kheer.

I had the biryani last week in my Paying guest accomodation near to this venue.

First time  I am trying this biryani.

Reasons-

Biryani flavours are not in proportion and loads of oil floated with oil. Felt like had 500gms of empty ch

Raitha has a terrible stink and onions & curds were not fresh enough.

Gravy for sides are terrible it tasted burnt with more hint of garlic and nothing else not a bite of onions or tomatos.. soaked with oil OF COURSE...

TripAdvisor,After reading many ads in papers announcing opening of few outlets offering Banglore's famous biryanis we though of giving it a try. Though priced reasonably the fact that the biryanis are prepacked sealed and stored at outlets then heated before delivery put us off. The freshness is missing. Taste too just average. We are definitely not trying again as freshness in biryanis is the key factor.
