"The first time I came here, it was absolutely brilliant. The location is convenient and having total mall beside is even better. The rooms have a very good feel to it with its futuristic design, fully loaded facilities and great view. I like how everything is well-organised and put together especially the mini bar. The service is brilliant also as they truly treat their guests well. Breakfast at Tangerine was brilliant, coming here for the second time and loved it again. Brilliant assortment of items from typical English breakfast to the local south Indian dosas, cumulation of fruits and juices all also added well to the menu. The only issue was when we wanted to use the swimming pool and upon confirming timings with staff I paid a visit there after good breakfast at Tangerine, but I was sadly disappointed by the pool, from the picture shown in Make My Trip and what it is the reality is far different, it is unhygienic, construction is still W. I. P. Around and the worst part was that upon returning from pool to lift, we were surrounded by a swarm of bees, Davanam should seriously consider this issue as we saw a mini hive on the outside roof from our room window at 501. If you do look into this issue, ill be motivated to come back here as I like the roof pool concept and would love to take a swim there. Clearly the highlight of Dvanamn is there service and upon sending this feedback they assured immediate action of the same so hope that does happen. Overall, worth the stay, its really good place to relax yourself!   ",1,1,3,3,3,3,2,3,1,3,1

Made a whole lot better by the service from MakeMyTrip staffer, Vijaya who offered a discount when I was making my payment which was icing on the cake. Never ever thought I would be satisfied paying a price for a product. Here I am breaking with the past. Great value for money. All good, no regrets.

Nice place. Perfect getaway at luxury but swimming pool needs to be done as soon as possible. There was no changing room and working shower but else all fine.

"Its awesome hotel. Location is little bit wierd as no ola cab person wants to go that location, I dont know why?? It is about 45.2 km from Airport and it took 84 minutes for me to go to airport. It is about 12 km from majestic station back exit and it took 56 minutes at 12 pm due to high traffic. The hotel is nice from inside and its located beside Market square mall, which has KFC, Mac donalds and a few branded shops. To go to orion mall u have to go to Mantri square metro stop which is 12 km from hotel and take a metro directly to sandal soap factory or you can go directly to orion mall which is around 18 km by road. The rooms are quite spacious, and breakfast was super cool. I loved the hotel and would like to stay there in future.",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,1

"This hotel has by the far the most spacious rooms I have ever seen. Huge! Very neatly maintained. Great decor. Everything in the room is spaciously accommodated. They have 2 TVs - one for the living room area and one facing the bed (So if your better-half is watching a different channel and you want to see a match, you can happily watch by lying on the sofa - very comfortable :-P). Bathrooms are neat and clean with perfectly running hot water. The room is just perfect. The Food is not great. Even the tea I ordered was not good. The dining area is nice but the food can be improved for such a nice facility. Next time, I would find a place outside for food. Breakfast is okay. Dinner was not great. If you go to such a nice place, I feel you should be least worried about stepping out for anything but I would have to step out for good food. And it is right next to the busy madiwala road and so it is a little loud though the sound is a little muffled with the glass window. You can hear buses honking there till about 12 or so and early in the morning. Other than that, the place is great. I would happily recommend it to anyone. It is a little bit expensive if you directly book though the place is totally worth it. I would recommend booking through Goibibo for amazing rates. To me, this booking was a steal!",0,2,3,0,1,1,3,3,3,3,3

"Food need to be improved a lot. You don't find the inroom dining menu equivalent to the 4 star hotel. Buffet Break fast is good. If you come from outside bangalore, you need to know the hotel's location address. Because no cabs or taxis knows the exact location of the hotel even if you mentioned the hotel name to drivers. Better to ask for the city view rooms. Otherwise you will feel that you are in a closed room. Staff is very quick and service is very good. Cleanliness is also good. Buffet breakfast is nice. Overall a very gud hotel except the food and prices of the available menu is also high, but you will not get the worth of it.",0,2,1,0,3,0,3,3,3,3,3
Worth the money ! Amazing experience ! Centrally located !,0,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,3
"Hello, I stayed at this property for 3 days and had an great time. Truly a 4 star hotel! They have beautifuly designed spacious rooms/suites with all the modren facilites and everything in mint condition. King size bed, sofas, office table, dressing table, cubords, 2 flat screen TV's, full size fridge, clean bathroom, etc... The lobbys are bright and beautiful. They have 2-3 resturants which are truly comforting. We just loved the food at this hotel, amazing breakfast buffet and the in room dining was great too. Do not forget to taste the south indian food, i feel they have the best south indian chef. The swiming pool is on the top floor (8th) and found it to be decent with great view of banglore. They have a conference hall right next to the pool so privicy is something which the guests might have to put up with if in case there is a conference going on by non hotel staying guests. When i say conference - large number of people in formals talking serious business and we in swiming suites happily swiming. Quite a contrast... We enjoyed though ;) They have a spa on the 7th floor and i found the interiors and the message room to be ok, but the service and the pricing was good. The location of the hotel is on a real busy highway and near to the famous traffic jam hotspot 'silk board junction'. So getting to this place and going out on a rush hour traffic is quite tricky. The hotel is in a small mall and it starts from 4th floor. You have Mc Donalds, KFC and other eatries on the ground floor along with few other shopping options up until 3 floors and then the hotel starts. The entry and exit to the hotel is quite narrow and the parking in the basement is general parking for all since its in the mall premises. And now the staff!! They were amazing.. Quick check in, speedy room service, energetic and always greeting you with a smile and ready to help/serve you for all your needs. They can easily match the customer service quality you get in western countries. Overall the busy location should not take away even half star as in every other aspect its totaly worth every penny. I am looking forward to stay at DSPS again. Thank you.",1,1,3,1,1,3,0,3,3,3,1

"At a prime location, this is walking distance to few places around hosting a mall in the same building. The carpet is not properly done in the walking areas. I was scared that I might trip off. In the room, it doesnt feel that I am staying in a well maintained hotel paying expensive tariff. The Bathroom is not well done (construction wise as well as setting up bath towels, shampoo etc.. was the worst I saw). In one of the initial rooms I was allotted, the toilet was not working properly, I complained about this the next day and it took them around 12hrs to move me to a better one. The water pressure was pathetic. If a neighbor starts taking shower, the water pressure drops to such a level, you will get a very thin flow of water and if you are accustomed to use the handheld toilet cleaner, you are doomed :) The bath tub was too high to climb into and the shower curtain doesnt cover the entire area. Now you can figure out, why there is water in the non tub area even though you didnt spill any water. On positive side, the staff is very courteous, the restaurant is very good and they serve good food. House keeping was prompt and when you ask for something in the room, they will be at your door in no time.",2,3,1,3,2,3,3,1,1,3,2

Checked-in at 5 am on 27th Jan & checked out at 6 am on 29th Jan- had to pay 3 nights charge. Would have understood if the hotel was full to capacity or if I had not pre-booked it. Would have also been ok to pay half a night's charge for the early check-in(which is what happens in other hotels). Have been a regular guest for my business trips to the hotel- expected better customer service and common sense from the front desk.

Hotel staff, right from the Room Cleaning Service to the reception and also the staff from restaurant are very cooperative and well mannered.

"I stayed six nights at the hotel as part of a business trip, And this is the second time I was staying at the hotel.

The rooms are very spacious and well equipped, The restaurant offers an excellent breakfast as well as dinner rich and varied.

But above all significant advantage of the hotel is the excellent service you receive.
All the hotel and restaurant employees were courteous, attentive and always happy to help.

Another advantage is the small mall next to the hotel. It allows you to make small purchases until late.",1,1,1,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,1

"Highly dissatisfied and disappointed . I checked in late and ordered good and drinks with room service at 10:15pm, 10:45 I call to ask what happened, sir 5 minutes you will be served. 11pm I asked how long is your 5 minutes and response is sir boy is on his way .

11:15pm bell rings and the guy is standing with the drinks and told me other guy is following him with food.

11:45pm they decided to bring food which of course I refused to accept and asked for the manager. No one called or came to see me .

12:15pm I get a call from room service saying sorry sir we forgot your room number despite me having called 3 times to remind them of my order. I asked for manager again and yet again cold shoulder. No one seems to care .

Checkout time I find the food being charged to me which the person in the desk decided to wave off seing my reaction.

I must honestly say I would never return and never recommend anyone. Clean rooms but as long as you have no expectations for service and be prepared for rudeness if front office staff that greeted us on the check-in and ignored everything we said.

Management should wake up and see what their staff is doing.",2,2,2,3,3,1,3,2,3,2,3
"Best business class hotels for urgent trips . The rooms are spacious and well equipped with all basic amenities .
I would choose this hoetl for its location and room price .


Food is average though and the rates for restaurant is a bit high , if thats taken care off then its all great .",1,0,3,0,1,3,3,3,1,3,1

"They have to satisfy customer requirement.
I have paid rs.5100 for just 6 hrs.
After checkout when requested for room for freshen up.they refused.they don't delight customers.I don't recommend this hotel to friends.",2,3,2,3,3,2,3,3,3,2,2

"The rooms are massive according to the price.. You get a big room with sitting area and a large bathroom at a nominal price.. The breakfast buffet was good and there were plenty of options..
The other good thing about this place is that it is located on the Hosur main road, which is quite accessible.
Also, there is a small shopping complex adjoining the hotel which boasts various shopping stores and dining options..
Overall, stay was good and comfortable.. People at reception were quite helpful.
The only thing I felt that needs improvement is the rooftop swimming pool.. It was not operational at the time of my visit..",1,1,3,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,1
"Frankly, I had to book this hotel because most of the bigger, known hotels were fully booked during that period.

I was hoping that I wont regret my decision.
The excellent rooms and services in Davanam Portico made sure I dont.

This is one boutique hotel with outstanding suites.
The suites are fully equipped- from 2 separate beds, TVs, bathroom, a couch, a study table, large wardrobes, kitchen sink, cooking utensils, gas and cooking range, microwave oven and electric kettle.

Service is quick and friendly.
The hotel itself has two nicely kept restaurants where u can enjoy food.
Food in both is very good.

The only watchout is the location- It is on top of a mall (Total mall called previously) and is almost inconspicious on the road while driving. Parking is an issue and u may need to talk to the hotel to get help in advance.",1,3,1,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,1
"I stayed for 7 days. Excellent service, clean and spacious room. Good spread of breakfast. Big advantage is the Megastore right next to Hotel entrance.

Will definitely stay in this hotel during my next visit to Bengaluru.",1,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,1,3,1
"this is my second time visit to davanam, we were not lucky for a free upgrade like last time but nonetheless the service was flawless and the experience was the same. looking forward for another stay here as we would not want to miss the location, deal,amazing rooms and the service",1,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,1
"We stayed here for 4 nights in July 2016. The entry and exact location of this hotel may not be great but the overall location is nice and is close to Koramangala and Madiwala.
The reception is decent and beautifully decorated. The check-in was quick and we were offered some delicious chocolates while completing the formalities.
Coming to the best part about the hotel - the rooms. The rooms have to be the best rooms I have ever stayed in. It is humongous. The rooms are so spacious and cozy, you won't want to go anywhere and just stay in the room. It is not just the size but the whole environment of the room which just makes you feel relaxed. It has a special soothing effect. It is beautifully decorated. The rooms are well-maintained and clean. The bathroom as well is spacious and clean.
The staff as well is very courteous and friendly. The room service is quick. The restaurant waiters are incredibly courteous. The security guards are helpful.

Some of the things which can be improved are :-
- Wifi. We weren't provided with the wifi password even after asking for it a several times
- Restaurant food. The food is pretty good but can be improved a lot.",1,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,0,1,3
What a great food and service in this restaurant!! Specially thanks to Mr.Mahabeer Singh Restaurant Manager. He helped us a lot for making our group dinner memorable.I would like to visit again if I come Bangalore.,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
"I stayed here for a single night.
Check in was fast and check out was also not took more than 5 minutes. Good
Can't comment on room service as not required in my stay. Room was clean and neat. Very specious. Swimming pool which is on terrace was also good. Person standing there asked me to share feedback.
Restaurant - Service is best. I had dinner as well as breakfast. Satisfied.
Will defiantly visit again.",1,3,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,1,1
"One of the best hotel, I have stayed across the Globe. Rooms are very spacious, comfortable with all the amenities inside it. The staff is really good and always ready to serve you for all your needs.

Excellent restaurant with International as well as Indian cuisine. Hotel is well connected with city.

This place totally surprised me with their service, comfort and hospitality.",1,1,1,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,1
"I stayed at this hotel in October, 2016. It is situated on the Madiwala Main Road where it meets Hosur Road and just adjacent to Total Mall. Kindly note that this road is a one way road and you are not allowed to enter it from the Hosur Road side. The Hotel has a Reception Area on the Ground Floor from where you take an escalator to the Main Reception Area. The entire Hotel gives a feeling of extremely large spaces, something that is quite rare in Bangalore. The Reception Area is huge, their restaurant is large with heavy, difficult to move furniture and their Rooms are really very big. The Room size is approximately 650 sq. ft. with a Kitchenette Area followed by a drawing room and then a bedroom with an attached dressing room and a washroom which is accessible from both the dressing room side and the drawing room. The hotel is very properly maintained and housekeeping attends to the room satisfactorily and there are no reasons to complain. The internet connection for 2 devices is satisfactory and in case of any problems the reception resolves them ASAP. The complimentary breakfast is an extensive spread which caters to all tastes. If you are looking for a large room to stay in South Bangalore, this is the right place. They also have a rooftop pool. All in all, a very good experience.",1,3,1,3,3,3,1,1,2,1,1
"As my other hotel was fully booked so I couldn't extend my stay over there, my local office suggested this hotel and when I got there, the entrance is very small, reception is on 4th floor, check in was fast and got a room on the 7th floor.

Walked inside and the room was massive, kitchen sink, large fridge, sofa in the living room with large TV, walk in cloth changing room, toilet with bath tub, the king size bed has a smaller tv to look at, the bed came with 4 pillows and 4 cushions, a bit too much :) Bed was very comfortable, the room has 2 AC systems and since I came from HK, to access the wifi I had to enter my HK number to register and it worked but not too well, the internet speed was very slow and keeps disconnecting, without good wifi nowadays, it can make or break a hotel.

The restaurant for breakfast, the food was mainly Indian local food and small selection as western, when I got there, there was only around 10 customers but it took me two times asking for Black Coffee to finally get it even though there was plenty of waiters.

Food was ok at breakfast and the menu inside the room has many choices and the price was reasonable but I didnt have time to try it.

Outside the room in the very long corridors they constantly play music through speakers from the sealing, very scary in the evenings depending on what music is being played as the corridors is very LONG and not very bright, inside the room you can sometimes hear the music which I thought was actually coming from the shopping centre below.

My room window looked down inside the shopping centre so no traffic noise was heard.

Below the hotel and right next door is a Shopping centre which has Mc Donalds, KFC and a local restaurant, 3 floors of a large supermarket but not much else, good for walking around for a short time.

As the Wifi speed was really horrible I would only stay here again if my other hotels were fully booked even though the price is very good.",1,0,2,0,3,3,2,3,1,3,1
"Excellent king size comfortable rooms. It gives you a feeling as if you are staying at your home. The staff here are courteous and always ready to serve you on your inputs/requirements.
We have done an event for our employees and the hotel logistics was done seamlessly by Ms. Razia. I am really grateful to her and would look forward to work with her again.

The food and drinks are delicious. The chef is very friendly, he is polite enough to take order for us directly.
The hotel is well connected. There is a small mall which is hardly 50 steps far from the hotel porch. The only not so good part is the vegetable/fruit market which is near to the hotel.

Really appreciate your amazing service! Good job team and keep it up!",1,3,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,1
I had a bit of difficult time to chase the staff to get a thing as trivial a leaky lap. The breakfast was never a great experience as the staff did not really make me feel welcome. They did not seem to enthusiastic to help.,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3
In connection with my official tour I used to stay in hotel almost in every state but first time I stayed at Davanam. Really it was a good experience. It has a big comfortable clean rooms equipped with all necessary facilities.,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,1
Although some may not find the location of the hotel to be ideal but to a business traveler like me having the hotel close to the highway and adjacent to a mall is what worked for me. Good food and huge luxurious rooms. Recommended for all looking for luxurious stay at a reasonable price!,1,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,1
"I was not expecting to be such a lavish stay. Its one of the most premium properties of Sarovar Portico, across the nation. Rooms were super spacious and ambiance was also great. Nevertheless food will make your palate fall in love with it. Over all a great experience !!!

One request, please tell your staff (at top floor, near swimming pool) to behave with Indian Customers, the way they treat with foreign customers. Customers are customers, whether they are Indians or Foreigners.",1,1,3,3,1,3,3,2,3,3,1
"Neat and tidy, takes care of customers to the utmost satisfaction. Great going. It gives the customers most satisfied stay in the hotel, Quality of food and service pattern is WOW. New commers can have a glimpse of Bangalore/Madiwala location very clearly by viewing from the top floor",1,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,1,3,3
"Stayed in Davanam Sarovar during my visit to Bangalore in October. The hotel is more like a hotel apartment, and the rooms are large sized, studio type with a living space, a study separated by a partition from the main bedroom. Thoughtfully designed, the room allows for the bathroom to be accessed from both the living room and more privately from the bedroom.

The reception is on the 4th floor, as the ground floor-plate is shared with a mall, which I thought was an interesting idea. We had a room on the 6th floor, and the room was spacious, and well decorated, with a kitchenette and two televisions, meeting or exceeding the standards of an executive suite.

The breakfast was good, but lacked international cuisine. Fruits, cereals were limited, perhaps most of the guests are from the Indian subcontinent.

The internet was slow, and the WiFi password is not provided at check-in, but is sent by an sms. A very dated system. Internet is slow, and sometimes doesn't work at all. Another issue I noted was the fact that electricity seems to go frequently and the back up is slow, so there are frequent outages that disturb when working.

The other major issue is the traffic. The hotel is right on the busy intersection of Hosur and Madivalla road, and the traffic on Hosur road is continuous throughout the night. Make sure you avoid a room facing Hosur road unless you wish to experience a sensation of sleeping in the middle of traffic.

All said, the package is a mix of good, and could be better.",1,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,1,3
"Reviewing a place like davanam portico is trying to think on how many positives to put in a review so as to be fair to the resplendent name they have carved for themselves in the hospitality scenery of Bangalore and elsewhere. We reached at about 8:00 am and checked in and were given a free upgrade to a luxury suite. Point to be noted. It was a luxury suite in every sense of the word luxury. The front desk also went out of their way to help us plan our trip of Bangalore and outskirts. The location is adjacent to a mall and at a busy traffic intersection but the rooms are absolutely cut off from the noise. The bed and bath furnishings are modern and clean. The bathrooms are big and spacious. The housekeeping staff is prompt to the extent that after a while it seems as though a member of the staff is posted right outside the door to address your needs.
The wifi however was a bit iffy and was bit unstable. However, upon telling them they took care of it in as good a manner as anything else. The breakfast spread was varied and fulfilling and high on the taste ground as well.
This place is truly a wise mix of business and pleasure hotels.
My best to the management and staff.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3
"A Good Property at Prime Location with a Shopping Mall under your Hotel .
What else you require and when there are only Suites Rooms to offer it will surely be your first preference for a Perfect Stay.
But when i enter the room , there were many things which was not expected.
They have a Kitchenette but without Microwave which is of no use.
Then you have a Big screen TV in your room just one feet away from your Bed and a Small TV in Living room which makes it a bit funny. It has to be vice versa according to the Room Sizes.
The bathroom are very small as compare to rest of the room.
And Last which makes me angry is the Bed Size .They gave me Twin Bed which is too small for an Adult .
When i asked F.O Staff for a Single Bed Room, they were laughing and told that they are sold out.
I personally checked with HK dept and there were many rooms which was empty and that too Kind Size bed.
I even told F.O dept that these are the room no which are empty , so kindly shift me in that room but they didn't bother and told me the same story .
The same problem was reported by my friend who was staying in other room but they did the same thing to him as well.
The maximum staff was at the F.O and the least staff was at their restaurant which was shocking. I have traveled across the World but no Front Office staff behaved this way to me like they did .They didn't addressed customer problems rather laughing in their own peer group.
If you have better option stay away from this Hotel if service is your prime aspect.
Overall Bad Staff but Good Property to Stay :(",2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3
"Room was spacious. Staff was co-operative. They warmly welcome you with chocolates and juices.
Only thing for improvement is, there were power off few times that may be due to load shedding, which they must look into.
Overall Nice place to visit.",1,3,2,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,1
"I stayed at Davanam Sarovar Portico for 11 nights with my family. The Deluxe Suite room was very spacious and clean. The bathroom was also nice and clean. The hotel's Tangerine restaurant served delicious variety of north and south Indian food in daily breakfast. Also, the tangerine restaurant served excellent variety of north indian food in buffet dinner. The hotel's chef Mr. Ravi has excellent culinary skills. One of the Tangerine restaurant's staff Mr. Virendra was very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would surely stay at this hotel again. I just want to give 1 suggestion that there should be a bathrobe, bathroom slippers and an ironing board in the Deluxe suite room.",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"The stay at this hotel was so good that it most certainly warrants a review. Everything about this place was really great. Location was excellent. Room was amazingly clean , comfortable and bright. But the staff at sarovar were even better. Everyone here needs a special mention. Right from the check in to the buffet breakfast to check out every one was very warm, friendly and helpful. Food was really yummy. Room service was great too. View from the terrace near the pool was breathtaking. Definitely staying again at Davanam. Highly recommended !",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,1
"Having stayed in 2 of Sarovar Portico properties earlier, I was quite excited to see what does Davanam have to offer. The drive to the airport was uncomfortably long as you would expect from most hotels in Bengaluru. To be precise, it took about 51km from airport even though the airport is in Koramangala.

What's good?
We ended up conducting two of our meetings right inside the hotel lobby as it has sufficient space for the meetings to be conducted and most people are aware of the hotel location.

The room we were allocated had a separate working area and was very well spaced out.

The staff was very courteous including those at the restaurant.

What could have been better?
The Wi-Fi speed left a lot to be desired, being a business hotel one would expect better and responsive Wi-Fi.

Will I be coming back again?
Certainly for the size of the rooms and the decor.",1,3,3,3,1,3,2,1,1,3,1
"The hotel is situated in Koramangala and is housed in a mall.
The hotel has huge rooms(read suites) as it is an all suits hotels
There is nothing flashy about the hotel and thats exactly what i loved about this place.
The service was quick and the breakfast was tasty",1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"I have stayed in Sarovar hotels in at least 15 cities in India. Happy to say that I liked this one the most.
One of the top features of this hotel is the room which is like a small suite. It is nicely appointed and spacious. The appointment of the room changed the flavour of the stay.
The staff was very good, very well trained and responsive.
I took dinner and breakfast next morning. Again the food was a notch above the standard fare you get in such hotels.
Only problem is the location. It is far away from everywhere! From my meeting venue in Gandhinagar, Fortune JP celestial, it took one and half hour in the evening.
However, well done Davanam Sarovar.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,1
"Rooms are quite big, beautiful, clean, worth every penny.
Hotel is well maintained
Brkfst was extremely delicious and filled with loads of options
The staff were extremely helpful alwwyz ready to help
I highly recommend this hotel if u planning to visit bangalore.",1,3,3,3,1,1,3,1,3,3,1
"The staff in the reception is very bad. Also the hotel asks for credit card numbers, expiry dates, etc, which is not permitted by the banks to disclose to anybody. So please beware of the credit card fraud which might happen from this hotel.",2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3
"One of the luxury suites available in the junction of whitefied and electronic city two IT hubs of Bangalore and close to most happening place in the town, Koramangala.
The suites are very tidy and cozy. Ambiance is perfect.",1,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,1

One mall is just below to grab items needed pronto. Other malls and shopping places nearby. Overall good experience.",1,3,3,1,3,3,3,1,3,3,1
I stayed at this hotel from 31.08.2016 to 03.09.2016 and its a superb hotel. very spacious and beautiful room. breakfast is awesome and every day new menu in breakfast is the best thing. hotel staff are very friendly. overall great stay.,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,1
"Hello, I stayed at this property for 3 days and had an great time. Truly a 4 star hotel!

They have beautifuly designed spacious rooms/suites with all the modren facilites and everything in mint condition. King size bed, sofas, office table, dressing table, cubords, 2 flat screen TV's, clean bathroom, etc... The lobbys are huge, bright and beautiful.

They have 2-3 resturants which are truly comforting. We just loved the food at this hotel, amazing breakfast buffet and the in room dining was great too. Do not forget to taste the south indian food, i feel they have the best south indian chef.

The swiming pool is on the top floor (8th) and found it to be decent with great view of banglore. They have a conference hall right next to the pool so privicy is something which the guests might have to put up with if in case there is a conference going on by non hotel staying guests. When i say conference - large number of people in formals talking serious business and we in swiming suites happily swiming. Quite a contrast... We enjoyed though ;)

They have a spa on the 7th floor and i found the interiors and the message room to be ok, but the service and the pricing was good.

The location of the hotel is on a real busy highway and near to the famous traffic jam hotspot 'silk board junction'. So getting to this place and going out on a rush hour traffic is quite tricky. The hotel is in a small mall and it starts from 4th floor. You have Mc Donalds, KFC and other eatries on the ground floor along with few other shopping options up until 3 floors and then the hotel starts. The entry and exit to the hotel is quite narrow and the parking in the basement is general parking for all since its in the mall premises.

And now the staff!! They were amazing.. Quick check in, speedy room service, energetic and always greeting you with a smile and ready to help/serve you for all your needs.

Overall the busy location should not take away even half star as in every other aspect its totaly worth every penny. I am looking forward to stay at DSPS again.

Thank you.",1,3,3,3,1,3,1,3,3,3,1
"I have stayed here 2nd time, great location, good food, nice helping staff.

Rooms are really large, you can do a small meeting/get-together in room itself.

Everything was good at hotel. Good for families as well as business travelers equally",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,1
I had an amazing stay at the hotel. The suites are very luxurious and good to stay. The thing I liked most about this hotel is the hospitality. The whole staff is very cooperative and polite. Food is super awesome.,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,1
"Not many apartment style hotels are seen nowadays and Davanam Sarovar or Grand Mercure in Bangalore are exceptions.

Nothing new that other reviewers have not covered ... massive rooms and depending on which room one gets, there is always something different for example, this time I had a walkin wardrobe. Their internet service has really improved and no complaints on that front.

Housekeeping and hospitality continue to be top notch. Room service is tasty and not very expensive as well. The breakfast buffet beats Grand Mercure as well.

Wish they could do something about the room lighting as it is dimly lit for such a massive room size. Also water pressure in the bathroom could be a bit of hit or miss.",1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,1
"Service is very good.
Room is excellent.
Prime location beside More mega mart and have all the services.
Food is really nice.

"Stayed there for a week. Well let me list down USPs of this hotel:

A) Room size ... Massive .. It's a suite guys.
B) breakfast layout ..great.
C) F&B staff and team. Just awsum .. Interactive, always eager to assist. Forgetting names of team members but really, hats off to them.
D) Price in restaurant. Affordable.
E) Japanese cuisine - delicious
F) Affordability in terms of price of room .. Oops sorry .. Suite.

If you intend to stay in or near Kormangala, this is the place ... thumbs up to Davanam Sarovar Portico",1,1,3,1,3,3,3,1,3,3,1
"Excellent Hotel with amenities. Located near/ on the way to electronic city hence very good location for people having work near to these place.

They have good restaurants to take care of your choice of food.",1,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,1,3,3
"My friends and I came to Bangalore from a variety of countries for a wedding and needed somewhere close to the venues. The location was excellent. The staff were fantastic, always so helpful and friendly. We loved our rooms, they were so spacious, clean and well set out. The furniture was comfortable and ideal for when we were all gathering in one room after dinner or when getting ready for going to the wedding events. The breakfast buffet was excellent, plenty of options and a huge variety of food and drinks. The restaurant staff were always welcoming and helpful. The room amenities such as the tea and shampoo were very handy. Room service was delicious and prompt. The free wifi all over the hotel was very good.

There were two lovely women from the hotel staff who helped us drape our saris for the wedding who were brilliant. We would not have been able to manage without them! They did such a great job and we received many complements on how the saris looked.

My main and only small concern was the lack of microwave and glassware in the room. The small kitchen was very impressive but seemed a bit pointless without some form of method to cook or heat up food. Also, when ordering taxis, especially for the airport, the differences between the regular taxis and the hotel car/taxi should be explained in terms of reliability of showing up when ordered and cost. My friend was a bit tense when we were still waiting for a taxi to show up 30 minutes after we had requested it to arrive, despite booking it that morning and confirming the booking a number of times during the day. The traffic was worse than expected and it was very close to missing the flight. Having said that, the hotel was also brilliant when another friend realised at the airport that she left her passport in the hotel safe and the hotel was able to arrange a car to take her passport to the airport to meet her, just in time for her flight back to London. We were so grateful!

Overall, it was an excellent stay and we had a fantastic time. I highly recommend this hotel.",1,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,3,3
"It is INDEED a very unique title for this review. It comes from someone who has stayed there more that 12-15 occasions in the last few months. I shall reveal the context in midst of the review

Those who don't know Bengaluru well a bit background about the location. This hotel is part of the Total Mall which is next to Madiwala Police Station/Madiwala Market. Madiwala is just half a kilometer or so from Forum Mall Kormangala. The landscape around Madiwala is far different from that of Kormangala. Madiwala is a busy junction mainly inhabited by migrant families from neighbouring Tamil Nadu. They have been there since more than 30 years plus and hence it has its own characteristic landscape whereas Kormangala has developed fast in the last 10-15 years. 20 years back it was considered outskirts of Bengaluru.

The hotel is part of the total mall and it looks a massive structure while you approach it from Electronic city and as you come closer you will be shocked with very small driveway. Ground floor is just the travel desk the lobby is on the fourth floor. The lobby is another shocker as it has very weird ceiling which makes it feel more low that what it is and very claustrophobic. It is huge with ample seating. One side is the reception desk, the ONLY restaurant and bar opposite side and either side are banquets and exec offices and NO Natural Lighting. The best part of the lobby and restaurant entrance are the Bronze Traditional Figurines n Traditional Cotton wick lamps.

The check in always has bugged me as they have never acknowledge my repeat visits but the worst part being their security scan of Govt Id's. They have also insisted that the picture be taken with the web cam which is only unique to this place. This they have done once or twice with my permission and twice I have caught their staff do the same discreetly without my knowledge which I found it to be Fishy.

Its an all suites hotel with atrium. Half of the rooms face the Atrium which is MALL. And the Atrium is huge and in one of the floors or all of the three floors it is not a full rectangle. i.e. if you were allotted a room at the far end which is the dead end you will have to walk all the three lengths of the atrium and mind you its a long walk, hence First Tip - Ask for a room near the elevators for two reasons to avoid the long walks and secondly this is only place where you have french windows which brings in Natural Light.

Most of the rooms are huge with kitchenette, seating area and Sleeping area/Bed room. In some rooms there is walkin ward robe and or Dining Table. There is only one washroom though which is connected from Seating and Bed. Since I have stayed on many occasions the rooms are not standard sizes, they are huge but the dimensions vary. There are few rooms (near the elevator of course) are like junior suites bit of seating area and bed. The only thing common in all the rooms is the huge floor lamp, the picture frame of Yellow Tulips and one most common thing is the Frame of ""Golden Nested Eggs"" right above the pot in the washrooms.

Almost all the rooms windows - Atrium facing or road are very small. Considering the overall size of the room and small windows gives a feeling of sitting in a Golden CAGE more so if you are in a Atrium facing rooms you CANNOT afford to open your curtains as you will have another room facing you and the Mall ofcourse. Irrespective of the facing the nights could be noisy either due to the Traffic of busy highway below or the night/early morning cleaning at the mall.

The washrooms are good with shower stall, soap dispenser for handwash, etc but the bath soap which they give in bar form is floral scented and huge. Total put off and waste. some one staying for a night would waste the bar either due its sheer size if not surely due its floral fragrance....imagine a man smelling all floral after a shower. I did raise this up many times but no changes there.

The restaurant is huge and has equally huge sofas which are too comfortable and heavy to move. There are very few standard chairs except for the far corner which looks quite deserted. The bar is quite sad especially with Cocktails I had a classical cocktail which is supposed to come in a whisky glass or roly poly, it came in a Champagne Saucer looking and tasting something else only.

The buffet spread for breakfast and dinner is very good with live counters for Pasta during dinners, Omelette-Pancakes-waffles for breakfast. South Indian is finger licking good and Biryani which is part of daily dinner fare is worth a try. Service too has improved over a period of time to being very quick and efficient. There was a point when it was pathetic but I have seen a see change quickly.

Ohh yes there is roof top which has pool and banquets. It offers birds eye view of the landscape of the vicinity. Good place to chill in evenings provided there is no event in the hall close by.

They offer free WiFi which earlier was very high speed, the last few stays it has been decent not like before.

This place is surely worth staying for its large rooms and good food just excuse the view",1,0,3,3,3,1,0,1,1,2,1
It was nice overall. Only glitch was Wi-fi speed. The room was amazing with a wonderful city view. The ventilation was great with natural light filling up the room. The service was commendable too. So I hope to visit again.,1,3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3,3,1
"Just in town from Hyderabad one night. Off to meetings in the morning. Hotel is insanely great. I was upgraded to an executive suite for free. Spectacular rooms. Staff are friendly yet extremely professional. Restaurant was great for dinner, then a business meeting. Breakfast has great selection: Indian food, American food, omelette bar, fruits, and really good, strong, fresh ground/brewed coffee.
Staff are so good. Especially Sonu in the restaurant. She made me feel at home, a long way from home.",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,1

"The rooms are very large, probably 70 m2 with own kitchen, the staff is really great, restaurant, and bar all good. The only thing is that it's next to a busy street so it can be noisy. Overall I would highly recommend this place for business travel.",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,1
Very Poor hospitality espically fornt desk staff there behaviour was like a Dhaba hotel This was my first Stay at Saravour Portico Property if it is there attitued every where then i feel they are not greared to handle business travellers. i will think thousand times before staying here even if offered a free stay,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,2,3
very nice rooms. located right next to a shopping mall. service by hotel staff exceeded expectations. the property doesn't seem like one that opened in 2004. it's maintained very well. the buffet spread was really good. nothing to complain about the property.,1,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,1
"Rooms are very nice and is very well located if your office is in the middle of the city. Due to the pressing work I was unable to check out their breakfast but I am sure it would be good.
Staff is very friendly and helpful. Two AC zones in the room gives you the comfort of maintaining different temperatures in living and sleeping area. Six seater sofa and 2 bar stools lets you invite your business guests in your room itself.
Good food too. I tried Italian and continental cousine both were good.
Because it is part of a Mall, shopping is never too far..don't expect to get the luxury brands or great nightclubs though.",1,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,1
Visited with family for vacations. Easy check Inn . Upgraded rooms even without asking. Room with drawing & kitchen with modren interior impressed us . Wide spread buffet was also delicious. I will give 5 out of 5 to this hotel,1,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,1,1
"We had a training arranged here from 11 through 14 June facilitated through GRT Consulting.

Food is awesome. They offer a nice variety of breakfast. Being solo traveler, I was little afraid initially. But after my first visit I was confident that the place is safe to stay in for solo traveller's esp Females.

Thank you for such a wonderful hospitality !!",1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"Stayed in the executive suite for 4n 5d. The suite was extremely spacious with all modern amenities. I must appreciate the house keeping staff for maintaining the rooms since they were so clean. There was a light not working in my room and the technician fixed it within 5 minutes of making a call. Now that's called amazing service. Be it room service, in room dinning, wifi access, the service was absolutely within minutes. Also, I had ordered food from outside and the hotel not only allowed it but also provided with empty plates and cutlery. Would also like to mention special thanks to one of the housekeeping staff (I don't know his name) who arranged for a vase in my room to keep the bouquet of flowers I had received from my client. That was done during the room clean up when I was out and was a pleasant surprise for me. The hotel in room dining food is good and the staff has always been able to provide food within 30 mins of placing order. The buffet spread for breakfast n dinner is good too. Try the pancakes and veg fry wonton. The rooms are split into a working area, sitting area, kitchenette, bedroom and bathroom. 2 televisions - bedroom, Hall. Since I was on a business trip, i could peacefully work in the hall n working area with my office colleagues. The staff is very courteous. Check in and check out was within 5 minutes. No hassles. There is a swimming pool on rooftop with a nice view of the city. The hotel has facility for takeaway breakfast between 5-7 if you need to travel before 7am when the breakfast starts. Rooms face city or inside a mall. It's adjacent to a shopping mall with a supermarket and some factory outlets. Overall a good place to stay.",1,3,1,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,1
"I stayed in this hotel for one day. The rooms will actually make you feel that you are living in five star hotel. The rooms are spacious, neat and clean.

"Had gone for a business visit for two nights and little taken aback on seeing the location and entrance of the hotel.

Check in was nice and quick but rooms was great. The rooms were big spacious comfortable, clean . The bed and air conditioning was great. The room overlooked a busy street so was very noisy even at night , but was so tired that it hardly bothered me. For light sleepers it will be a problem

Had 4 meals in the hotel and all very below expectations.

Dinner Buffet : Service was nice and staff courteous , but all food was served cold and some dishes tasted stale.Though some dishes were cooked well but serving them cold spoilt the taste. The deserts were horrific and should be avoided

Breakfast : 2 days: It was a regular breakfast as in any hotel but for the fact the fruits were not good, cold milk not cold, breads and cakes hard and stale. They even had two items from last night dinner buffet leftover in the bearkfast

Dinner : It was the worst meal. We ordered soups and out of 8 available in the menu only two were available( that also from buffet) even they were not served hot. We ordered for some beer that was given in the menu and they had just one brand out of 10 listed. I donot understand the reason for having large menus when you actually dont want to serve it
On ordering a main course dish fish in lemon butter sauce, we were surprised to see that 4 pcs of fish being sent on our table without any sauce, salads, vegetables inspite of that being mentioned in the menu. On calling the waiter we were told that this is the way that the dish is served. When asked to see the menu and called the chef and the manager did they agree to change the dish and supplied us with salad , bread and sauce.

Room service and house keeping was prompt and commendable. If they could improve on there food part then can be a great place for business traveller",2,2,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1

"I stayed at Davanam for 3 days and clearly got impressed with the rooms, cleanliness, food and service. The staff is courteous and prompt. I would highly recommend this hotel to couple of people:

- All husbands who would like to pamper their wives
- All vendors who would like to pamper their angry customers",1,1,1,3,3,1,3,1,3,3,3
This was my first stay in a business hotel and I was mind blown. The suit was very spacious having two TVs one in the drawing area and one just comfortably located in front of the bed. the temperature control is very good. The restaurant below is pretty O.K.,1,0,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,1
"I stayed at this property for 3 night during the second week of May, 2016. This hotel is situated at a very convenient location. However, traffic could be a problem, especially during office hours. Rooms were nice, large and well maintained. Everyday, we enjoyed our breakfast in the hotel. There are plenty of things to chose in the breakfast.",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,1
"Breakfast has great options. Its at an ideal location with Mall attached, we went on shopping and and had Gala time, Cleaning my Car without my knowledge was a WOW factor. Mini-Bar was apt and very moderately priced.
Great Team there would love to visit again.

"For me it is the best hotel in Bangalore and the best place to stay near Koramangala, HSR Layout and Electronic City. The rooms are spacious and it is located above a shopping mall where you can buy everything. I liked the dinner buffet very much because in one week it did not repeat much. Everyday some new specialities. For the breakfast the hotel offers good cheese (which is rare in India). And I found that the croissant are chrunchy and the juices not too sweet (seems not so much sugar added what I personally like very much). The variety and the choice of food is very good. From the roof top I had a really spectacular view over Bangalore but also to relax at the swimming pool. The hotel seems to have a lot of Japanese guests which have a high requirement for cleaniless. Therefore, I can fully recommend that place. I think the place is perfect for long and short stay.",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"I stayed in this property for a short business trip to bangalore. I chose this hotel, based on the positive reviews and its proximity to electronic city and whitefield.

Location - Good location, on hosur main road , opposite to madiwala police station. It is close to prominent industrial areas and famous forum mall . A few good eating options and bars are within 3 km radius of this property. The hotel shares it's walls with a small mall which houses few shopping options, KFC, mc donalds and mega departmental store (More).

Note - ""More"" departmental store has a decent collection of wine, IMFL and foreign liquor. People who enjoy evening drinks in the comfort of their rooms must explore this .

Hotel - A typical four star sardaar sarovar property, nicely built and impeccably maintained. A small gym on 5th floor and a decent sized pool on 8th floor can be used for relaxation.
I observed that too much chlorine was used in the pool, making it difficult for swimmers.


Rooms - Huge airy rooms, very practically designed and kept very clean. Comfy couch and ergonomic work bench was very much appreicated. The rooms have well stocked mini bar in a full sized refrigerator.
Decent sized bathrooms with good amenities. The water pressure was a bit low in the shower, no complaints though.

Food- Good food, optimum quantity and quality, acceptable prices for its class. Well spread buffet breakfast with plenty of options for Indians as well as westerners.

Service and staff - Professionally trained and courteous staff.

Overall a very good experience in this property.
Very happy to recommend to friends and members of the forum.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3
"Very spacious rooms, nice and clean. Prompt service, good food quality. Food options available are good too. The location of the hotel is not that great. It is located in a rather busy area and not too much view around. The approach to the hotel was dug up too.
Overall a great place once you are in hotel.",1,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,0,3,1
"Nice hotel at a good location with good service. I was there for 2 days for a business travel and the stay was pleasant. The rooms are big, food was good. Only small issue I had was that the internet was bit slow and not gets disconnected frequently.",1,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,1,3,1
"for the price, its a fantastic hotel. the breakfast was amazing, their restaurant was also beautiful...starting from pork sausages to indian food...it offered everything. the rooms are spic and span, the bathrooms are fantastic. total value for money i say1",1,1,3,1,3,3,1,3,3,3,3
"Last week, we at our company had arranged a national summit for one of our clients and selected Davanam Sarovar Portico Suites for the same. The hotel did perform more than expected. It has a perfect business ambiance and the staff is very well equipped with business etiquette. The banquet hall is quite sophisticated with a robust internet connectivity and projector display. Kudos to Davanam for an amazing arrangement!",1,3,3,3,1,3,1,1,3,3,3
"The rooms as usual were very big,because of the all suite conformation of the hotel. That said,our room was a corner room facing the mall. There was about 1/4th of a window. That was all the view we had from the room. It was claustrophobic with absolutely no sun light. I asked for a room change but that was turned down. I stayed there for two days and I can't believe another room didn't come free,,because I noticed a lot of rooms were checking out. They just didn't bother despite me asking 4 times. And it was really a very bad room that we got. Whenever you are checking in,please ask them and make sure you don't get a room facing the mall,and if that cannot be helped,atleast get a room that's not in the corner.
Breakfast was great,variety and service was awesome. The restaurant is the highlight of this hotel,always.
Overall would have been a good stay but was severely let down by the jail like windowless room.
I ll include a photo,the curtain covering the supposed Windows? Only they are not Windows. Only half of one of the curtain is enough to cover the only window there. Rest of it is a waste. The room is always this dark and depressing.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,1
"This property provides you with whatever you would normally have at your home.
It just doesnt disappoint you the amenities on offer.They have gym facilities along with swimming pool right at the top of the property which gives you an amazing looks of city.",1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3
"I stayed with my friends who had come from delhi.

The room is adjacent to the Mall, we have suites with refrigerator and alcohol.

Its in a busy area but you will never feel when you are at your couch.

AC rooms for smokers available.",1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,1,3,1
"Super rooms , very spacious, very clean and well maintained - good restaurant - overall superb experience !! The interiors are kind of classy and has a very service apartmentish feel.

Recommended if you are in this side of Bangalore (koramangala).",1,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,1
I stayed here with my mum for a wedding. We found the hotel and staff to be super friendly and thankful for the kind lady who helped me and my mum with our sarees. Really liked the wine here. I think it is called grovenor. Convenient for shops and getting into the city is easy too,1,3,1,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3
"I have been visiting this hotel for a long time now. The rooms are pretty spacious, well designed and very clean. The staff is very helpful and responsive. The breakfast buffet has a lot of variety and the food is very delicious.",1,1,1,3,3,1,3,1,3,3,1
"Very nice experience. It feels home to stay here. kitchen and lobby seperate. buffet is also good but there is no eggless items. Room service good and Its located on very busy road near forum mall of b'lore. Due to Traffic chaos, it takes time to and fro everywhere. Visit areas are some distance away. We can book cabs for this or Best is to avail Metro facility for far places as traffic chaos. But this suite is nice. we Definetely stay again here",1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3
the hotel is located at madivala a place in bangalore which is near to forum mall the hotel is cosy and have got good rooms with good room service and good staff i took a room for like 5K inr via a hotels booking site online and it was totally worth .... they have a good breakfast menu i think i would definitely stay there if i go again,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,1
we had been here for buffet lunch and the food was very tasty especially the chilli fish which was served as a starter overall experience was nice and the price is also less for buffet. Thanks to chef..........,1,1,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
"I stayed in a one bedroom suite complete with kitchen, a small sitting room with tv. Bedroom was compact and somehow I felt I am living in a home and not in a hotel. It gave a feeling of comfort which made me happy !!! The decor was good in the room and outside in corridor. Breakfast menu was elaborate and just not the southy fare. Ample parking space and nice front desk staff. Only issue is that the reception is on the seventh floor. I WILL STAY IN THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!!!.",1,1,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,1
I have traveled to this hotel on a business trip and the hotel was very good and also in prime location. All the rooms are clean and even the breakfast is awesome. Nice pool at the terrace. Worth staying there.,1,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,1,3,1
"Stayed @ this hotel for 4 nights from 28th January till 1st February 2016.It was a great stay,comfortable very large room with a living area having separate TV, a small kitchenette, although with no appliances,only refrigerator and sink,they do provide a microwave on request, nevertheless a beautiful and luxurious accommodation. only negative was the surrounding area is a vegetables market with some filth around but that is not the properties' fault. Got a great bargain from nearbuy, a subsidiary of makemytrip .",1,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,2,3,1
"Beautiful rooms,excellent service,good food & a luxury stay.
I would just suggest one improvement - We were expecting a dinner at terrace but couldn't get that service , otherwise would have been a better experience.",1,1,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"Excellent location for travelers, just between madiwala and silk board. The rooms are really big(literally big suites as in the hotel name) and well maintained. The food was excellent and breakfast spread was also good. Room service was quick and overall a excellent place to stay. The property also has a roof top swimming pool.",1,1,1,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,1
The hotel room are huge in size and have all basic amenities complimented by a quick service. The only problem is that the approach road in front of the hotel is under construction resulting in difficulty in reaching the place.,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,2,3,1
"Hotel is very convenient location wise. Mall with stores and grocery in one side and fresh market on the other side.Room is like an apt. With a kitchenette and full refrigerator, a living room and a bedroom. Free wifi in the rooms. 2 wide screen tv,
Best part is the free buffet breakfast which I would described as lunch. We ended up not eating lunch and most of the time no dinner. The whole staff were courteous , friendly and helpful. The down side is the market side but I would say it a govt problem",1,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,1,3,1
"We stayed for 2 nights and was quite satisfied with the room and services. The room was quite bigger than expected. The best thing is that it is built on a mall, so you can shop or eat there.
Breakfast buffet was large enough with hell lot of varieties.",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"I am not commenting on the stay in this hotel, just about reception.
Yesterday I had been to the hotel after around 9 PM at night.
We had gone there from Kanakpura and we went to enquire about accomodating around 20 people next month.
We were asked to wait by the manager while he attended calls and chitchatted with fellow mates.
Then when finally he acknowledged us he was too brisk and just asked us to send a mail, saying he will reply on mail and was not ready to give approximate quote.
He outrightly refused to show us any room and gave weird expression when we insisted.
We are really disappointed for having travelled so far after office and getting this treatment.
Hope the front desk learns to be courteous.",2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3
"I have been using this hotel every year since 2012 and they have high standards and an excellent team which are very helpful. For years of staying there, they have an amazing manager Prashant. Hotel room is very spacious.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,1,1
"The last two times i had called before visiting the hotel that i would like if it was possible to get a room that has a view, on the phone the front desk confirmed and noted that it would be so, but at the visit it was said no such information was communicated.( it is so that either I'm lying or they are).

So at the second time i visited i.e 29th aug, due the confrontation with the front desk they gave me a small room which was attached to your suite. that time they had said it won't happen again.

31st dec visit was the worst of all(Thank you for spoiling my newer!!!). At reaching the hotel the front desk manager was least interested in solving my problem, after a prolong argument which they said that no call was done by me and no information was conveyed. It took you hotel 2 hours to give me room. The first room had two single beds, with a request of a single bed, this room dint even have its AC working. After been shifted to the second room, it dint have a fridge, no telephone, no hair dryer.

And worst of all was the conversation with your front desk, he stated that the rooms which we are giving you are a upgrade, i would like to say two things firstly ever time i have stayed at your place i have been given a different room, and secondly the pictures online and what your front desk explain and said about the room types is totally misleading.",2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3
We had awesome stay at Davanam Sarovar. Hotel rooms were excellent and very spacious. The food offered was excellent and the services of the staff members was also wonderful. We are glad to have choosen this hotel for our stay in Bangalore. We will surely recommend and will stay again if we get opportunity.,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"This is undoubtedly my best hotel stay so far. I fell in love with the room the minute I entered it. The building is huge, the interiors are very soothing and staff is courteous and helpful. The food is also great. I highly recommend this for family and couples. I couldn't find a single fkaw with this place. Loved it. Will visit again.",1,3,3,3,1,3,3,1,3,3,1
"I landed at this hotel by chance: We had been travelling all day- from Chennai to Bangalore and inside Bangalore, when I go hit with low sugar. Checked out the nearest affrodable hotel, and found this within 4 KM. Did not want to blow up 10K on a overnight unplanned stay.
Went in in the evening, found the staff pleasanrt however, the price - 6000++ adding to 7200/night was definitely on the high side. The room was a suite, spacious with separate areas for dining, kitchenette, lounging and two beds. Definitely comfortable.
I missed out on the hotel's amenities like spa and restaurants, but had a relaxed night.
If you want to check out the neighbouring areas, there is plenty to see and do, though a bit on the rough end. The mall in the hotel building was a disappointment.
Was it good ? Yes. Was it worth the tariff ? No. The rate should have been at least a thousand less.
Else, it was a decent experience.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3
"It's very good where we can stay very peacefully and very clean staffs are very
kind and very polite and the hotel is very good location outer part of hotel look bit crowded but it's ok when you are inside so no reason to say no for this hotel and also its budget friendly",1,3,3,1,3,1,3,1,1,3,3
"the ambiance, privacy and service provided by the hotel is nice. The staff were friendly and helpful. Hope they would continue the same further. It would be nice if maintenance people were bit attentive and careful.",1,3,0,3,1,3,3,1,3,3,3
"Though I landed in Sarovar by chance, but it was a pleasant one. Like the hospitality, the room is just awesome. The food buffet is very reasonable and has got a good spread. I just had one night to stay there and this is a disappointment. Will surely be there the next time I visit Bangalore.

The only bad thing is that the access to it. The rooms have two TVs but they are small considering the size of the room.

If you are looking for a nice stay in Bangalore, this is the destination. Its on the Hosur road and thus the accessibility also is not a problem.",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3
"Spacious, Luxurious, Clean and well maintained. Courteous and helpful staff. Elaborate breakfast menu. Good variety in IN Room service and decently priced. Refrigerator stocked with good variety. Free wifi. Enough channels in cable TV. Enjoyed the stay, never needed to contact anyone for any issues during my 3 day stay.",1,1,3,3,3,1,1,1,3,3,1
"The hotel was fantastic. The location may be a problem for few as there isnt much nearby and the location itself is near some market, but once you are inside the hotel, it is marvellous.
The food options were also good and had variety on different days.",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,1
"It was a pleasant experience in my 4 day stay at the hotel. Rooms were big and clean with English TV channels. Wifi was provided for free as a value added service. Food was excellent. Importantly, hotel staff were friendly, helpful and accommodating. Excellent!",1,1,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,1
"Stayed for 5 days. The room / suite was very good, well kept. The view was poor. The food was good. Limited spread. Good courteous staff at places, would recommend the place even if the location is a little inconvenient on the traffic packed madivala road. The only negative was the adamant front desk staff that refused complimentary breakfast on the (morning) day of check-in citing rules, despite me telling them that i wouldnt be having it the next few days in morning.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,0,2,1
"I was there for 2 days with my friends. It was very comfortable stay. Seeing hotel from outside one can not believe the quality but once you enter inside you can really feel the difference and fell the warmth.

Food was great and services were awsome.

Will visit again whenever traveling to Bangalore.",1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
"Location is very convenient and it is very nice property to stay,big rooms and overall very good experience.Good service and very good breakfast,nice placeto stay and good customer service.convenient to reach.",1,1,1,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,1
"Davanam Sarovar, Kormangla a fantastic business hotel, very spacious room, friendly and efficient staff and more over lavish buffet breakfast with number of options to choose and enhance your taste buds.",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,1
"Excellent service by the staff. Amazing ambience overall an awesome stay with my family. Food is awesome and complimentary breakfast is too good lot of varieties to taste.Centre place in kormangala and also near by to other places in bangalore.
Awesome stay...",1,1,1,3,1,3,3,1,1,3,3
"Hotel is located near Koramangala, which is no doubt a happening place. There is a mall adjacent to the hotel building where you can find mcd, kfc . Den services offered by hotel were commendable .room was a suit room . They provide you with induction and microwave also . If u want to cook and eat . Overall I recommend this place . Amazing place to stay in Bangalore",1,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,1
"Service and facility all so nice.
I was amazed open the room door, room,because floor is so big.
It may be an improper expression, noisy klaxon sound struck my ear from outside.
But that wouldn't be much of a problem.",1,3,1,3,3,3,1,3,0,3,1
Rooms are very spacious and comfortable. Very good hospitality. Value for money. Food is excellent. The only concern my room is far away from the elevator. Lavish Buffet breakfast. Definitely I recommend to all my friends who visit bangalore.,1,1,3,3,3,3,0,1,3,3,1
"It seems the Hotel is not managed by the Sarovar group as the quality was really poor
Less Food Option
Breakfast Buffet not upto the Mark
Gym Equipments are also Poor
Pool not functioning
Rooms are not Noise Proof - You get the Traffic Sound Whole Night",2,2,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,2
I stayed in this hotel the second time so no doubt I went back there as I liked the Hotel. The location is bad due to it being right at the end of market area however once you enter the hotel you forget it. Very nicely done and a good property with modern facilities. Tasty food and a nice buffet spread.,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3
"I had checked into this hotel to celebrate my mother's birthday and this property was a complete pleasant surprise for me. I have lived in Bangalore before and have seen this place in the middle of a crazy junction next to a mall, but never thought this place would be this great

Considering I was checking in with my parents, the front office upgraded us to a bigger room. The suites are extremely large, with great moving space across the rooms. The bedroom was a bit cramped, especially the space between the window and the bed, but otherwise it was ok. The bathrooms felt like being in a super luxury suite

We also managed to have one meal (lunch) and breakfast and it was completely worth it. Something unique about their breakfast was that the food tasted like home cooked ones",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1
"I stayed at this place with my family and i must say we all were very happy with the overall stay. Nice spacious rooms, a big enough living room, kitchenette and if you need anything the staff is always there with a smile to serve you.",1,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"I am a frequent traveler and I stay in many hotels of this group and I find Davanam Sarovar is best till date.
Buffet for lunch and dinner are good, but i feel they need to add some more options during breakfast.",1,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
"Stayed in The Hotel for a day For during a Business Trip to Bangalore

1) Real Big , Well Furnished and Well Maintained Rooms .
2) Real Good Food , But Costly
3) Services are Really Good , No Comparison
4) Location is Also Good , Centrally Located
5) I got the Room at prices way less then the Published prices, So it was a Value for Money for Me

Book The Hotel Online or through a Agent , You would get real Good Discount",1,1,1,1,3,3,1,3,1,3,1
"The executive suite that i was put up was outstanding, it had a living room, a fully functional kitchen and a bed room. The amenities included a 40 inch LCD both in the living room and bed room and a full size fridge in the kitchen. The linen was fresh and the toiletries were branded.

The complimentary breakfast was amazing, one of the best I had in recent times. The staff at the restaurant and reception were very courteous and serred me with a smile. Overall a great place to stay in Bangalore",1,1,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,1
"I stayed at this hotel 3rd time and every time I get excellent service. Staff is great, many healthy varieties in breakfast, they have small but very nice gym too. Dinner options are great and staff is always willing and standby to please the customer. Rooms are vary spacious, nice, and clean. I would certainly recommend this place and location is great too. They have small mall right next to the hotel, so if you can go for indoor walk and get a bite of local delicacy or western food.

Only thing they I didn't like was their internet connection - it was slow at times and down couple times during my stay. So, I hope they fix it for good.",1,1,1,3,3,1,3,1,3,3,1
"Located adjacent to a Mall with great rooms.

You practically feel at home at this place - huge space with large living area with open kitchen. Separate bed area with wardrobe space and bath. A good study table and chair. One has quite a walk going from one room to another.

Their staff is amazing -- great service attitude at checkin, on housekeeping, for any technical internet help to the restaurant and everyone makes you feel welcome and takes special care.

Breakfast spread is awesome with fresh juices, fresh parathas, waffles in addition to a massive spread of Indian, Continental and Japanese items (probably they must be hosting Japanese tourists and travellers - have not seen this in other Bangalore hotels). The buffet is worth a try as well - might end up on borderline gluttony due to the huge spread and the fact that staff takes special care of hotel guests eating at the buffet.

Sleep quality is good - nice pillow selection and a conveniently placed television in front of the bed. This one is smaller TV compared to big size television in living area. With two separate thermostats - cooling the room is not an issue.

Kitchen is good - they usually place a microwave and you can ask front desk for an induction cooker and other utensils if you need to cook.

On the improvement front - I would say that lighting needs to be brighter and also internet speeds have gone down lately. Used to fast earlier and now its jittery that affect business related work like conference calls. Both I think could be easily solved to make it an even greater experience.

Overall great place - will stay again - best value for money hotel.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,1
"There are too many good things to write about this hotel. The location is great - close to Total Store, Forum Mall and a number of great restaurants. We stayed in this hotel for 2 days and through our stay, we kept admiring this hotel for something or the other. The staff - right from front desk to Room service to restaurant - is class apart! We wanted to heat up milk for our baby and the room service provided us a brand new microwave and an induction cooktop in no time. During the conversation, they got to know it was my birthday the next day. Everyone from room service gave me a big surprise and brought flowers and a yummilicious cake on my b'day. They made the day even more special. The rooms are another big plus - they are very spacious and neatly maintained. You feel as if you are living in a spacious one bedroom apartment with a walk in. It does not stop here. Coming to food, the hotel restaurant serves amazing food. Their lunch and dinner buffet both are delicious. The spread is not that great but everything tasted great. There were so many starters that you will not even feel like going for main course - and all of them were good. Fish tikka, honey glazed crispy veggies, noodles, potato tikki and chana dal halwa - to name a few - tasted so delicious - everyone must eat in their restaurants while staying at the hotel. Total value for money. This hotel truly deserves to be in the list of highly rated hotels in the city - worth every penny!",1,3,1,3,3,3,3,1,1,1,3
"Last month, we planned a South India tour. Therefore, for a week we stayed in the garden city. My niece, who is in Bangalore, booked rooms for our stay at Davanam Sarovar,Madivala. The hotel rooms are very large; I was really astonished when I saw the size of the rooms were so lucrative for the charges I paid. Being a North Indian family, we enjoyed the delicious North Indian food and to our surprise we came to know that the hotel is best at its Japanese cuisines.We had full Japanese meals, but felt the cuisines were so awesome.We definitely loved our stay here.",1,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"In avery good location. Hotel offers extreme luxurious rooms. Breakfast is great and services is awesome. Rooms are the USP. If you are looking for luxury in budget, It's a win win situation to opt for this hotel.",1,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,1
"I have stayed at this hotel for around 15 days in 3 stints over July and August. First and foremost great rooms..big size good layout well equipped and well maintained. ..really comfortable. But that actually is not the best part of the hotel...I travel around a lot a spend good amount of time in different hotels...and the staff of this hotel will surely rank in the top 3...real great staff courteous helpful and the best part engaging...they really connect with their guests...
Location is great depending on where you have to travel in Bangalore.
The food is above average...decent selection but gets boring after some time...may be because I stayed for 15 days ...
One thing I found which was unusual and not sure if the hotel would like me pointing it here..the rack rates and the negotiated rack rates for an individual is always higher than make my trip which is what I use..the hotel was not ready to match. ..at a professional level I appreciate their stand...personal level not sure I like it...but no complaints I booked on make my trip...

On the whole would recommend this hotel. .especially if you have work in South Bangalore",1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,1
"Location wise it's very near to koramangala and got best connectivity.
Staff always courteous and greeting you with smile.
Rooms are ultra spacious suites and very comfortable bed.Two Tv's, fridge it's was like living in 1 BHK luxiourious apartment.
You can check Total Mall and it has KFC & MCD and ofcourse nightlife in koramangala amazing.
Breakfast got good variety and staff always willing to help and take best attention of you.
Check-in and check-out was smooth, Wifi(free) was super speed as we connected 3 devices.

Overall recommend for both leisure & business travellers for thier BEST & QUALITY Service.",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,1
"We stayed here from 23rd August till 25th August. Property can be spotted just opposite to Madiwala police station. To my surprise the reception was @ 4th floor.
We had a smooth check-in. We had some issues in the 1st room allotted. But when raised an issue they changed our room.
The room service was prompt and good. The food was also nice . Breakfast had sufficient options and good staff around to help you in the restaurant

Nice and good place to stay. Highly recomended",1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3
"I've stayed many times at this hotel. I used to rate it highly. But not any more.

On the positive side, the rooms are big and the staff really does try to help. In particular the housekeeping folks.

That said, I will no longer recommend this place. For over 18 months they have been advertising pool and gym. But as of August 2015 it is still not functioning.

The room-service food is as inconsistent as can be. Order the same dish two days in a row and the dish will be prepared in two different ways.

Wifi service provider is seemingly changed regularly. But during my recent 5 day stay the wifi was incredibly unstable.

To add insult to injury, it seems that management don't really know how to price the accommodation and other services properly. Now they charge an exorbitant amount for airport pickup. And that in a mediocre vehicle.

I won't be staying here again if I can help it.",2,3,3,3,3,3,2,0,3,3,1
"I visited this place with my girl friend - we were there for 2 days. The hotel is easily accessible and is just on the Hosur Road next to Total mall. Very nice reception with a warm and pleasant welcome, check in was done in no time. Passages and surroundings were very quiet and the room was the perfect. I was in an Executive suite, everything one could look for was in place - 2 LCDs in perfectly positioned locations. Several relaxing options re sofa and chairs. A very comfortable bed to accommodate 2 people. Properly furnished. Very spacious bathroom. A minibar in place with the option of coffee making and cooking too on request basis. House keeping very prompt and room dining options throughout the clock. Additional facilities were gym, roof top pool and restaurant inside. For us breakfast was complimentary with a wide variety of cuisines. Very quiet and pleasant atmosphere prevailed. Privacy ensured. I would sum up by saying - state of art infrastructure and value for money; everything worth the price.",1,3,1,3,1,3,3,3,3,1,3
"I stayed for 5 nights in Davanam Sarovar hotel and enjoyed every second of my stay. All the staffs were very helpful and gave the feeling that they are truly willing to know your needs.
There are numerous possibilities for food from Indian, Japanese, and Chinese cuisines.It has a lovely tea house and nice shops with unique and quality goods. The breakfast was truly a heavenly feeling. The view from the room was awesome and the smell of fresh flowers that came into the room felt refreshing.",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3

Location of hotel is also ok about 5-6 kms from city centre.

In a nutshell

Food is good
Rooms are very spacious and have luxury feel
Service is good
Location is ok
Amenities are good

Thanks,

"This is one of the coolest places for travelers to stay in Bangalore. Davanam Sarovar Portico Suites is situated in Madivala, which is very close to major areas of the city. The area is well spread out. The hotel has a contemporary natural feel with windows all around. Bathrooms were very clean and functional. The dining menu offers a good and interesting choice.

Quality of food is like home cooking. Rooms are luxurious and classical. We have only beautiful memory of this restaurant. I am so pleased to have enjoyed our first visit and we look forward to visit Davanam Sarovar again.",1,1,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3
"The property is amazing. The suites are really big, well designed and maintained. The staff is very helpful. The checkin and check out was absolutely smooth and quick. The food was great. Overall excellent and worth the money you pay.",1,1,1,1,1,3,3,1,3,1,1
"this hotel is attached to a mall. So if you checking in request a room NOT facing the inside of the mall as it is depressing. location is good if you wanna be in Koramangala. the hotel starts on the 4th floor.
check in was smooth. wifi free for 2 devices only. my room was facing the inside of the mall (room 604)
the room I had was big. with a kitchenette, living room, dressing area, work area and 2 single beds. there were 2 TV's in the room. Clean, tidy. there were some spots on the bed sheet which could be clean. Bed were comfortable. Wifi is good in the room but the cell phone reception was poor
the bathroom is good but toiletries are poor in quality and quantity.
The restaurants has a Japanese menu. The veg sushi platter was good but the so called Udon noodles were bad. I think the chef need to understand what is Udon noodles What I got was flat noodles. Breakfast was good. good variety and taste.
I called the hotel and asked if there was a travel desk and was told there was. When I ask them at the reception, I was told they would help me. I wanted a taxi for the next day. The next day I has to wait for 10 min even though I had confirmed. the driver has no road sense. Thanks to google maps I made it to the destination and airport.
Check out was smooth.",2,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,1,2
"Had stayed in many 4 and 5 star hotels, even though this hotel is in a shopping mall, the locality seems okay, hospitality was good, food and dinning were perfect, very good staffing and worth for the money you pay.",1,1,3,1,3,3,3,1,0,3,3
"Have stayed in many hotels during my visit to Bangalore. But none of the experience was as good as davanam! The service, room, food, friendly staff, everything was just excellent. Have stayed here 2-3 times and from now on I don't need to think about any other hotel. This will always be my first choice. Besides all the excellent facilities their location is also very good, its next to total mall with has shopping,food joints and parlor and near to companies. Everything is just perfect about this hotel, would highly recommend everyone to choose this and I assure you won't regret staying here!",1,3,1,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,3
"One of the finest property I have ever stayed. Will love to stay again. Awesome staff and fabulous food.

Heads off to Mr. Prashant Nair he is a true professional he is a gem as he helped me in booking my room keeping my budget in mind and made sure services are at par. Hat's off to management for recruiting true professional's.

They served nice complimentary breakfast too. All in very affordable prices",1,1,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"The hotel has very good breakfast and living environment. There is big kitchen in the room, so can make some food by self. Also itâ€™s very convenient for shopping, as there is shopping mall and supper market under the hotel. Good!
A suggestion for improvement is that the pillow is not comfortable for sleep. One pillow is a little low for sleep but two pillows are too high. Better quality pillows may be better.",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0

"Since the hotel is ideally located in Madiwala, there is no trouble to travel toward Indiranagar or Kormangala. It has amazing and friendly staff and I just loved the food available here. I tried Japanese cuisine at Tangerine many times during my stay.

Good place to stay, if youâ€™ve work in the central locations. It has excellent front office and warm reception along with well-equipped rooms. Iâ€™m really impressed with the cleanliness and there wasnâ€™t much trouble in check in/check out periods. Would love to visit again!",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3
"this is my second experience with sarovar brand and the stay was good this time too. the hotel offers spacious, well furnished suites, good for business/leisure stays. room service and food at tangerine restaurant also were good. the location is convenient for those coming from chennai side who stop for transit (without entering the city) and want to proceed to mysore/coorg. There is a shopping mall adjacent to the hotel - so its a busy neighbourhood and parking is a shared one with the mall, which is slightly inconvenient.",1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
Met my requirements during my stay. Can improve on the Quality of Toiletries and Provide all the toiletries in the room for the Travelers. Lighting in the room can be better as its dark at some places I particular in the dressing area.,1,3,3,3,0,3,0,3,3,3,3

The food was great with the buffet spread providing a lot of varieties and the taste was awesome. The ambience was equally good.

Worth staying!",1,1,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,3

It was a very good experience and service was really excellent. Rooms are very spacious and each suite is completely luxurious. You can enjoy wi-fi connectivity everywhere in the hotel and drink lovers can visit Tangerine mini bar where you will get all international brands.

Second trip, I had same expectations but they met all of it.
I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying around this location (Whitefield, Hosur Road, Madiwala, Koramangalam)...

"I stayed in the premium suite, which was exactly like as seen in pictures. With all the luxury, the room had a great view of Electronic City flyover. The hotel is very clean and hygienic. And the staff is also very prompt and helpful. From outside though the hotel doesn't look very fancy,but their suits are THE BEST in the city. I had a great time there. will definitely visit again.",1,3,3,3,3,1,3,1,3,3,3
"I am from Bhubaneswar and my friend gifted me a 2 nightâ€™s stay with my husband at this wonderful hotel on the occasion of our anniversary. We stayed in their premium suite, which was like a palace room of 21st century with all the luxury. The view from the window was great, especially at night that showed the Electronic City highway lighted beautifully in dark.
The hotel is very particular about cleanliness and hygiene and we were awed with the staffâ€™s prompt response and assistance to plan our short trip in Bangalore. You may get luxury in other 5-star hotels as well, but the staffâ€™s behavior in taking additional charge to ensure our two days short trip went on well not just inside the hotel but outside too. This compelled us to write about the great hospitality of the staff at Davanam Sarovar Portico Suites.",1,3,1,3,3,1,3,1,3,3,3
"I was on a business trip to Bangalore and stayed at Davanam, but had also taken along my family so that the trip could double up as a vacation. I spent time with my family exploring the city during the evenings. The hotel team was very helpful and assisted my family members during my absence with their needs.
They even helped me plan my trip in the city, giving me suggestions and helping me book cabs for the tour. The in-house Tangerine restaurant catered to our food and snack needs- I should admit the food was really delicious. All of us had a very pleasant stay at the hotel and received the best service.",1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3
"I have never got to stay in Davanam Sarovar hotel, but I got a chance to be present there as a guest for a business conference held at the newly opened Hyde Park. I felt that it was a pretty good place for business meets and conferences. The venue is big enough for more than 100 people and they serve the best breakfast and lunch at their in-house Tangerine restaurant. Being a vegetarian, I got so many options to satisfy my hunger with delicious starters, main course, and dessert as well.
The staffs were pretty good in handling and arranging the things that we wanted.",1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3
"I am from Mumbai and went to Bangalore for a pleasure trip. I stayed at Davanam Sarovar and must say it was a home away from home.
It is located at the heart of Bangalore, so travelling to different places was not a problem. Thereâ€™s a mall next to Davanam, which is an added USP for the hotel. The staff here is very helpful. The food is also awesome at their in-house restaurant. I will give it 4.5 out of 5.",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3
"Great Business Hotel
Davanam Sarovar is an excellent hotel, centrally located in Madivala, Bangalore. During my previous visit to the city, I had booked a room at this hotel after reading some good reviews about the place and my experience at the hotel certainly lived up to my expectations after going through the reviews.
Right from my check-in to check-out, my whole stay was absolutely cool. The staffs were very professional and helpful, catering to all my needs. The room was also very comfortable and good, offering all the required amenities. A thumbs-up for the great hospitality the whole team is offering! Keep up the good work!",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3

Its a good hotel for stay!! Its located near shopping and public places. One can enjoy the service of the hotel. It is bit expensive. Food was good. The rooms are spacious. The garden is small outside.,1,1,3,0,3,3,0,3,3,3,1
"I have really enjoyed all my stays at this property till date. All the rooms are suits with a bedroom, drawing room and a small kitchenet - which is great for longer stays. The spread in their breakfast & dinner buffets are pretty decent. We also got free wifi with good speed. Although, the housekeeping service leaves a little to be desired, this is a great option, especially for longer stays

room for improvement:",1,3,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,1
"Perfectly royal - is the most appropriate word for this luxury hotel. We had come over to Bangalore to spent our honeymoon And had a stop over at Sarovar portico for a night. The room was unbelievably spacious and comfortable. It was a studio apartment sort of setup. It had a kitchen area with a fridge, coffee maker in it. It had a small study area and a pretty decent walk in closet too. The service was good. And to add up to it the food was excellent. The complementary breakfast was really amazing. Although a executive hotel but we as a couple found it very exciting. We simply enjoyed our stay over here.
Will really love to visit again.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1

"I had stayed with my wife and a child for 25 days, we had a great stay we were there for NAET treatment , we were well looked after our needs or any other suggestions we needed. Breakfast was great and the staff was very much attentive. We were provided with induction top for cooking some items for our child as there was kitchenette in the suites. Mr Prasant Nair is a great and very much helpful person. We had not booked for 1day in between due to non availability. Hotel was completely full but we were given priority for the reservation and the stay was managed by him for us. We would surely stay again.",1,1,1,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3

"The hotel is like amazing. The rooms are so spacious, so clean, all the amenities are like a 5star. Bathrooms were exotic, and the staff had taken care of the hygiene so well.

This hotel has amazing service with large spacious rooms, decent food, good ambience and excellent connectivity to all good places in Bangalore. The swimming pool is well maintained and my kids enjoyed a lot. We went to Barleys that is just near the hotel. The hotel staff assisted us with booking cabs for our trip. With beautiful interiors, the hotel has a restaurant named Tangerine. I can simply say that my visit was the best this time.",1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,1
"Checked in this hotel on 24.05.16 at 18hrs in evening. Had gone thru TRIPADVISOR'S re view's thoughrly and went for it .As the drive from the Airport to the hotel. is 45 km it took us 90 minutes to reach the hotel. Our executive suite 600sq feet Approximately is one of the biggest in the hotel history considering that it was mere 80 dollars or rs 5000.00 per nite for a triple occupancy on CP plan. Our check in was super express in room no 630. The room decors, ambions, partition of the room with a master bed room, separate kitchen and a separate living room with the best of air conditioning reminded me Oberoi Grand Kolkata (I still believe in air conditioning part, no one can beat Oberoi group). This property comes closest to it. Excellent room/ suite whatever u call it. Ordered for veg snacks like pakoda and Masala tea at 7 PM. Till 7.30 no response!. Reminded the room service who told that in 5 minutes it win reach my room. As my wife and Son were very hungry and their 5 minutes not 8 sight, dialled to the DUTY Manager directly and gave him a brief update of my Old Sarovarian Guest loyalty and also a senior contributor badge of TripAdvisor. He conveyed his sincere apologies and promised to rectify in no time. With in two minutes my food arrived hot and packed beautifully. As I asked for the bill I was informed that it was COMPLIMENTARY as a gesture of goodwill. We had our tea and snacks very good in taste and very well prepared. The F& B Dept. Called us separately and requested us to forgive and forget.Promised that for my entire stay they will deliver room service food within 20 minutes. I think the ever helpful duty manager (A true Professional) update all the departments under him to give us Spl. Attn. Ok. Now for the room menu. Quite pocket friendly like veg curries were priced at an average of RS 250.00 per plate. In Kolkata Sarovar property the average charge is RS 550.00 per plate. We had a sound sleep after dinner. Woke up at 10.45 in the morning. As the complimentary breakfast time was over I spoke to the resturent manager and Boy he took the decision fast and ensured free breakfast for three of us. The breakfast was combination of south Indian snacks some north indian as well as continental items along with fresh fruit juice and tea/coffee. Very good breakfast . Justified the five star rating. There is a shopping mall. along with McDonald's resturent and Domino's Pizza near the hotel. The do provide free WIFI with excellent speed. Overall a great hotel with magnificent rooms best air conditioning in Bengaluru city, well behaved house keeping/room service/polite and ever helpful front desk made my stay memorable. My advice: call the Duty Manager directly for any issues, take only hotel food (quite good and hygienic) , for pick up and drops dial Ola cabs (08033553355) their 24Ã—7 call centre no. With variety of A.C cabs and pocket friendly rates too.âœŒ.A must recommended property.Will stay at this property for my upcoming trips in Bengaluru.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"I would recommend this place for people who want to have a peaceful business meeting with a cup of coffee or would want to take their clients for a drink or dinner. The ambience is quiet and serene; soft music will allow you to talk to your associates effortlessly without troubling your throat unlike those many places where itâ€™s impossible to talk amidst loud music.
The seating arrangement is very comfortable that you can spend hours on the couch without torturing your back. A great place for business meetings!",1,3,3,3,1,3,1,3,3,3,3
"Davanam is one of the best hotels situated in the city centre. All the facilities offered are awesome. The room I got to stay during my previous visit to Bangalore was spacious and luxurious and so was their service.
The swimming pool is the plus point, giving people who stay here a chance to relax peacefully. The serene surroundings and interior decoration can soothe your mind if you are staying here. I highly recommend this place for business trips and conferences.",1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,1
"I work as an Admin head for one of the leading IT companies in Bangalore. A part of my duty is to arrange corporate conferences for my organization. This time, we required a space situated in the heart of the city so that itâ€™s easily accessible. So, I booked Davanam Sarovar.
Itâ€™s a hotel, which is at a fair distance from most of the business houses. The conference room at the 8th floor is really beautiful as it captivated all our guests. The design and interior was really attractive. The conference was conducted in a hassle free manner. The snacks and refreshment prepared by the hotel was really good and satisfied all the corporate delegates. I would like to rate Davanam with 4.5 out of 5 stars for their awesome corporate hospitality.",1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3
"Last winter, I planned a family vacation to Bangalore. So, my wife booked Davanam following a friendâ€™s suggestion. We were totally 6 people. I would like to thank Davanam staff who allowed us to stay in a single room, which was so spacious that we all comfortably stayed here for a week.
The rooms are highly hygienic and well maintained. Every once in a while, the room service staff used to visit and manage the room as per our requirement. The staffs were very well mannered and I would rate Davanam as one of the best family hotels in Bangalore.",1,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,1,3
"I feel for the owner of the property. He has a great hotel,in a great location but his staff will undo him.
The hotel is at Madiwala,very near to Koramangala,5km from MG Road and has a great location. Only complain would be the lack of parking space and the dirty underground parking shared with the mall in which the hotel is situated. But showing us that dirty underground parking could ve been avoided if the valet did his job. Instead twice he refused to take my car, instead telling me to go and park by myself in their very dirty and dark parking lot. My wife was with me, and I felt threatened by a lot of workers hanging around in the parking lot at 11pm at night when I went to take my car,because the valet refused to take it from there.
Check in was great, not friendly, but fast. They didn't tell me my WiFi password was written on the key card, but I guess they just forgot because it was writ ten. I just had to call them before I found out it was there with me all the while.
I didn't know they actually meant it when they called their hotel Portico Suites. This is the best part. Big huge suits with a Kitchenette with refrigerator, microwave and hotplate, a living room with TV,a bedroom with TV, a huge bathroom and a wardrobe, all for a price of a usual room. This was just great. And neat and well maintains. Great room service too. Food was above average.I ve been to the hotel before for dinner many a times, always lovin the food. But that was spoiled this time by a very poor poor service during the breakfast buffet. I know its a buffer. But there was hardly any customers and yet no one came forward to give me a table or ask me for anything from the live cooking. Even coffee which I asked for after trying ten minutes to grab someones attemtion took a further ten minutes before arriving. I just hated the entire breakfast because of the service. But the food looked good though.
Check out was easy too. No issues. Oh, and WiFi was one of the faster I have experienced in hotels.
Like I said before, the owner loved this hotel, the staff hate him and their jobs, and hence behave really bad.",0,3,3,3,3,3,1,0,3,3,3
very good clean and spacious room. Decent location as it is not very far from electronic city. It is in the same building as a mall so you get options to eat on walking distance. Electronic city is also not very far.,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,1
"It's an awesome place. Superb staff amazing facilities. All the three meals are very tasty.. They take care of their customers very nicely.
Only minus point is it's very difficult to commute since it's in the main city, getting there or from there to some other place is difficult.",1,1,3,3,3,3,1,1,2,3,3
"Hi, I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights for the business trip. The hotel looks good for me, rooms are clean and neat. But, it is far away from the airport, so air travellers may have to think before book this hotel. Thanks",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,1
"Sarovar portico was overall a nice hotel. Food was really good. Room was huge and facilities inside worked fine.

Location and surrounding of the hotel is very very awful!!!!",1,1,3,3,3,3,2,1,2,3,1
"Suit was very spacious. Good for Senior level Corporates. Very Clean, Prompt service. Staff was very well behaved. Excellent hygiene was maintained in restaurant. Food quality was good. Only drawback is that hotel located bit far from city center. Located in business area though namely Koramangala. Entrance is bit small but hotel is very spacious. Situated on top of the mall so you get variety of food and shopping available downstairs.",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,0,3,1
"stayed for 2 days (7-8 April)

Positive: Huge size rooms with ample space, internal designing, 24 hrs wifi, quick service, awesome food, great stay for 2 days, nice and humble staffs, prime location near silk board, Total mall in same building provides all your needs, beautiful madiwala lake at 10 mins distance, connectivity to all parts of Bangalore as silk board is the prime location of Bangalore, ideal stay for people travelling to chennai and other south indian states as located on main highway,

Negative: poor mobile network connectivity, external ambiance is completely commercial which may or may not please you.",1,1,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,1
"We stayed at the property for a night on a business trip. The property is ideal for people wanting to stay in/having business in south bangalore. The architecture is slightly odd as i guess the hotel is situated on a building which also houses a shopping complex on the lower floors. The hotel itself starts 4th floor onwards i guess. A few of the rooms also overlook the mall lobby.

The check in was smooth. The rooms are spacious with modern decor. Being suites, they also house a cooking area. A microwave and a some very basic crockery was also available. The room was architecturally slightly awkward but nothing wrong as such. I had a good stay and a great nights sleep.

The restaurant was pleasantly surprising. We had dinner buffet and breakfast. Both of which were excellent in terms of spread and quality of food. Dinner buffet priced at Rs. 650+taxes was outstanding and is highly recommended. The spread in terms of cuisines and desserts was brilliant.

Overall a recommended hotel with fairly priced rooms and food.",1,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3
Nice spacious suits providing facility for Executives & families.Separate sitting area offers comfort of reading . Separated LCD in sitting area and bedroom.

My 2nd stay at this hotel n the experience was beyond words...It just happened that I spent the last 2 birthdays of mine here...they made it even more special with a cake from their end...given a chance to choose any place to stay in bangalore...without any hesitation...this would be it...absolutely love the place...not to far from the city center...extremely hospitable staff..rooms are very spacious and well maintained...their breakfast spread is very diverse and fulfilling...the staff is kind and helpful...thank you for making our stays memorable :),1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
"Among the best modern hotels I've seen recently, keeping the utmost comfort of the traveller in mind. Anything you can think of in a room youâ€™ll probably find it. If not, the polite & courteous staff is ready to help 24x7. Had a very pleasant stay.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,1
"Good property, well maintained. Clean rooms, lights in the room were low, no way one can increase the visibility. One can easily skip the reception and has access to all the floors of the hotel.......",0,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,3
"The dining experience doesn't just means few good looking sofas/tables/lights. The food and service are two very important criteria for a guest in choosing a restaurant.

The food was OK but I have witnessed a drop in service compared to past few years. In this competitive world you can't afford to loose a customer you should be always on your toes to push the quality higher and higher and keep each customer happy and satisfied.

Hope you guys know your job better than me.",2,0,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
"Sarovar Portico is one of the best business hotels I have stayed in Bangalore. The size of the rooms are fantastic, the breakfast and dinner spread is awesome and the service of the staff is too notch. From the exterior it doesn't look too impressive as its attached to a mall next to it, but the impression dramatically changes once you check-into the hotel. It is a value for money hotel. Highly recommended.",1,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,1
"I stayed almost one month, and it was very comfortable.
Room is wide and clean, and staff is wonderful.
I could get everything I need at the Total super market.(It is very close to the hotel.)
I also enjoyed Japanese food at FUKUSUKE(4th floor).

Thank you!",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,1
Decent stay overall. Food at the restaurant was decent. Service at the restaurant there could have been better I felt. My room was like a studio apartment and lavishly done. Think they had upgraded me,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"Its on the main road. I stayed in room number 622. Room space is big. Having small kitchen, waiting hall, bedroom and a bath room. Bath room looks very small compared the overall space.
Very much noisy in the night due to facing highway.
Hotel food is good. But some staffs are not customer friendly. During breakfast, they are very rude.
Checkin and checkout is very smooth
Nearby, right side very good malls are located. Leftside big vegetable market located.
When i ask for food plater, shaving/toothbrush kit, immediately provided. I assumed, it must be default, not so.

Bathroom fittings/towels are very old. can be replaced immediately please",1,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0
Very poor and paranoid staff. When I was checking out I was stopped by the staff at the portico and was asked that I have taken along coffee mugs and glass from the room and was asked to frisk my baggage.,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,2,3
"Just next to McDonald and KFC, imagine. What else you need?
This is a best hotel and great value for money.
We stayed there for 5 nights and even after 5 nights, we never wanted to leave our room.
Room, so specious and full of everything. A real suite room.
Staff, very helpful and speaking good English and Hindi both.
Food, was ok. Not many options to choose from but price and in-room service was good.
Location, perfect. Easy to call Uber and can go any corner of the Bangalore.
Room Tariff, I think they are charging less then it should be charged but no complaint.
Cleanliness, this is why I given it a 3 star instead 4. Room was ok clean but bathroom seems outdated and dirty. Towels were very dirty and smelly.

Overall a good experience.",0,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,1
I stayed here on a business trip in Feb 2015 and surprised to see the size and dÃ©cor of room. Looks like living in a furnished flat. Food was fine too. A room to remember. Its an added advantage to have a good mall adjacent to the property. Its nice and big for shopping.,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1

I had an official visit to Bangalore and stayed there for 4 days. the suites come with almost all the facility that you look for in a business hotel. Rooms were spacious and maintained well. you will love to be in the room. Regarding food I must say being a Bengali the taste buds are very sensitive and the hotel does justice to my taste buds. Good variety I must say. the location is also wonderful as your family can spend the entire day in case you are busy with your assignments. Over all ""5 star"" to Davanam Sarovar Portico!!",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1

Otherwise its a nice place to stay.",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1

Restaurant is huge but spread is slightly requires more dishes. Staffs are highly cooporative.",1,0,1,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,1
Very good location especially if you are commuting to electronic city for work. Located close to the shopping mail. However the quality of rooms and service was below par compared to other sarovar portico hotels across India. The room layout was strange and hotel staff response was also quite slow. Breakfast quality was also average. Overall I would prefer to stay near main city but recommend it only for short stay and if you are primarily looking to save long commuting time to electronic city.,0,2,2,3,3,3,3,2,1,3,2

The rooms are very spacious, creatively designed and laid out and very comfy. Most noteworthy is the restaurant. The food quality is awesome. Every preparation we chose was wonderfully prepared and served. We requested some modifications to a few dishes and they were done to perfection. The chefs here are extremely talented.
The service people are very helpful and well mannered.
If I am going Bangalore again, I'll be staying here.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1

Wonderful interiors, very spacious and some excellent dining too, must recommend the hotel's Restaurant for the Starters that they give before the buffet.

"Hello fellow travellers,

I booked this through cleartrip because of some amazing cashback offers around 16th of January. I came here to attend an EDM concert ""VH1 Supersonic : Steve Aoki"".

They have 3 types of suites to choose from; Regular, Deluxe or Premier. I was staying in Regular suite for 2 days and shifted to another on my last day.

Rooms are big & spacious, Everything a 5 star service apartment offers but just one big room. Starts with a kitchen on the left, a living area with a cozy sofa for 4-people and 2 separate sofas followed by a double bed connected to a beautiful bathroom. Corner wall is a big glass, from where I could see mall from inside.

Service is amazing and one of the key factors why I will recommend someone to stay in this hotel. Bar on the 4th floor is okayish, nothing fancy. Parking was little messed up.

My last day stay wasn't planned as I was looking to either switch hotel or switch the suite in the same hotel as my friends were joining me. I asked the reception to show me the premier suite, which was quite good and big compared to the other room which I was in. I told them I will be taking the Premier suite and asked if they could offer me a better deal than Goibibo, they gave a good offer so I was happy and asked them to shift me. The very night I had the concert, By the time I came back to the hotel, It was late and I realised its not the same room as the one I was shown, so I intimated the reception immediately, they were like ""Sir, we can sort it out in the morning"". In the morning, I went to checkout and asked them to sort it out which they couldn't. They were telling me it was my issue as I agreed for a deluxe room only which was blatant lie. Why show a premier room when you are giving a deluxe?

Overall stay was good except the last episode.

Regards,
Rusty",1,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,1
"The stay at the hotel was really good. The rooms are clean and unusually big at the price. The staff is very prompt and courteous. The food at the restaurant was a bot of a dissapointment.

Fruit basket on arrival and Spa facilities are not available although it says so while online booking. Hotel information such as swimming pool, Gym was not available in the room.

However, the location is central for that part of Bangalore but the Madiwala market next door is a bit of a nuisance. I stayed there for 4 days in June on a family trip and found the place very convenient for navigating around the southern suburbs. The food at the in-house restaurant was good though the place was teeming with US company staff carrying out walk-in interviews. The hotel obviously has too many rooms and too much traffic for its staff strength and infrastructure.",0,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,2,3,3

Earlier I had seen such kind of rooms in Mariott But I never expected such Rooms to be part of Sarovar in their entire Hotel .

My Heartfelt thanks to the sarovar Team for the wonderful maintenance of the rooms & the Hospitality extended to me during my stay for 2 days . Its a Must stay for People visiting Bangalore & Guest who need to be Pampered with the Spacious Room they can imagine

Stay for atleast Once here & I am sure you will be saying the word Thank YOU to the Hotel Management . Food was Good & the service was worth mentioning .

Thanks once again .......",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1

"Hotel is located at busy junction and part of the Total mall near Silk Board.

Commute from airport take @ 1.15 mins with light traffic.

About stay
> The service is good and they seem willing and enthusiastic to help their customers which is good.
> The rooms are spacious and clean, the washroom are practical and they work as expected.
> Bed is comfortable
> One thing in notice and which was a big positive was that AC is on when you are away hence the rooms dont stink when you walk in or you dont have to sweat once you return from your work. This I think was a big positive.
> Rooms have hathway cable and hence you can pretty much catch on most of your fav. channels.
> Wi-Fi is realiable and speed decent to help you conduct your business effectively
> The food is good
> They take great care when you are their repeat customer which is a very nice gesture, i got updgraded and room had a small kitchen are
> Some rooms have kitchen with hot plate and Microwave, hence those who like to eath their own food or have senstive stomach this is a big positive, you can get ready to eat from the mall next door or buy vegetables from market just outside the hotel


Things that can improve
> No waste bin in room, you have to go to washroom all the way, not sure why ?
> Soap, it would be nice to have automatic dispensers with quality soap used
> Iron and Ironing board in all rooms is a must in business hotels
> Safety latches do not always work (it did not work for 506), this can be a small issue but good to address

"My only suggestion - please work on the food menu! The food variety and quality did not live up to the standards of the stay in rooms. Bringing food variety like that of say an example of Chutney Chang in Museum Road should be more beneficial to visitors!

Though I reported that there was no satellite channel/set top box for one of the TV's in my room (606) on day 1 - I was told someone from housekeeping would be sent to check it - but no one followed up. I too forgot about it conveniently. So there needs some improvement here.",1,2,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3

The only issue we found was with car drivers. We have contracted 3 different drivers for 3 days (airport drop last day). It was quite difficult to communicate with them in English. You could generally manage with English in Bangalore , so we felt it was an anomaly that drivers couldn't speak English.",1,1,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
"A perfect spot for an overdue get-together with 2 of my friends. got a room on the 6th floor, facing the mall. This could be a privacy issue if you are traveling as a couple, but the heavy curtains should take care of it, I guess, if lighting is not a concern.
Good ambiance, well appointed executive suite, responsive staff, quality sleep, and a clean neat and tidy in every aspect. The breakfast menu was repetitive, but was of very good quality & diversity. Stayed for 2 days and nights, and will definitely go again, or recommend to anyone. Located on Hosur Road, as part of the Mall, which makes it close to prominent areas like Forum, and koramangala & HSR, but the entrance to the hotel is on the other side of the mall.

"The hotel is very close to Silk Board and thus very convenient for business travelers. The suite we booked was spacious with a big living room and kitchenette, however, the room was really small. The bed was crammed in a corner such that one needed to climb the bed to go to the far end side, with the TV sticking out in between! Internet, TV, aircon, hot water, etc worked well.

Breakfast is mostly an Indian spread, and not suitable for visitors from abroad. The waiters are most helpful but the food was mostly luke-warm/cold. The front desk really needs improvement. Check-in as well as check-out takes a long time. If you do not check your bills, chances are you will be charged for things you have already paid for. The front desk staff need training in hospitality, they never smile or greet and are almost unhelpful. They look confused when asked simple questions.

To sum, it can be a good hotel for its spacious rooms and location if staff present themselves better.",2,0,3,3,3,3,2,3,1,2,2
"Arrived at an odd hour (3:00 AM); once I was able to find the reception on the 4th floor it went smooth. The suites are very spacious and well equipped which make your stay comfortable.

The A/C was working very good kept the room nice and cold. As others have mentioned, the rooms are a little dark & challenging to understand the lighting system since there are numerous switches. My main observation in regards to the rooms is, if you have two TVs both should be functioning with cable service. Out of the two TVs in my room only one was working, the TV which was in front of my bed didn't have a signal.. I was told that I could request in reception for them to bring up a second cable box, that the practice was to have only one. Then why have two TVs??

I found that the breakfast buffet was limited and what I did try my first day was not so tasty, to the point that I skipped it for the rest of my stay. Unfortunately for the dinner service I cant say much as the hotel restaurant had a private event and was fully booked. Had to have dinner at the mall next door.

As I had an early flight, the night before my checking out I had asked the reception to have my bill ready early in the morning to assure no delays; even though they had confirmed that it would be ready at the agreed time; when I went down to check-out I had to wait approximately 20 minutes to have my bill for food & drinks as the room was pre-paid.

If possible, arrange your own airport transfer to the hotel, the service provided to me was below standard, the car was not the greatest, the driver didn't speak a word of English and what made it worst was the price almost double; so if you are going to get bad service and dodgy car better get it on your own for half the price..",2,0,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2
"My family and I had two rooms at Davanam for three days. Although we had a rocky start, our stay was very comfortable. While checking in, the receptionist questioned my Indian visa stamped on my U.S. passport. He retained my passport to show it to his supervisor. Who knew that a hotel receptionist would double as an Indian immigration agent! I was ready to storm out, however, as we were late for an outside function, we checked in. Except for this initial problem, everything else was very good. One of our rooms was upgraded. Suites are modern, spacious, clean, and practical. Lighting was a bit too dim. The almost transparent glass door from the bathroom to the dressing area creates somewhat of a privacy issue, especially if you are sharing the bedroom with a non-spouse. The fourth floor reception was different from the usual. Parking was rather difficult. On the positive side, the restaurant was excellent. The breakfast buffet was elaborate. The service was excellent. Overall, I would recommend this hotel.

Message to the hotel - Trust the Indian immigration officers to do their jobs! You are not immigration! Do not make your guests feel unwelcome by questioning their visas.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3

Check in: The check in was very efficient. I was allocated a room on the 5th floor (532). The bell boy escorted me to the room. The corridor leading to the room was well carpeted and hence very quite.

The Suite: The suite is like a studio apartment. At the entry, there is a kitchenette with a couple of chairs for dining. There is also a sofa set for relaxing. The bedroom has a large bed. My only grouse is the lighting in the dressing area. It is too dark and the lights are not placed over the dressing mirror to see anything. Also the dÃ©cor is very dark and so there is no brightness. You have to invariably open the curtain to light up the room, but that window overlooks the upper floors of the mall. Not a very good idea!

Breakfast/Dinner: It is served in the restaurant on the 4th floor. The spread is good with couple of continental dishes, a few Indian dishes and the usual stuff.

Business Services: I was conducting a workshop there for 2 days, and the only complaint I have is that the power supply kept going off on day 2 repeatedly. I asked for UPS power to the projector but it was provided only at 4 PM on day 2, just 2 hrs before closing.

Special Mention: Mr. Prasoon who was assigned to us as the coordinator took very good care of all our requirements. The breaks happened at the stipulated time. During lunch also, he was there to ensure our needs were taken care of! Good job done, Prasoon!

Overall Impression: Very good suite, good business services, if only they could get the lighting in the bedroom arranged, it would be 5 stars!",1,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
"This is my regular hotel on trips to Bangalore. Beautiful rooms and quality service. Food is good as well.
The entrance and lobby are a let down but only hides the better parts.
Especially want to congratulate Sarovar on the good service, this is the third sarovar property I have been to and it has consistently been good",1,1,1,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,1
"I stayed here on two separate occasions and found the experience very satisfying.Rooms are spacious and clean.The reception was manned by very efficient lady who seemed to be over worked. The WIFI was very good . The breakfast buffet spread was excellent. The lunch buffet albeit being on the costlier side was good. The management needs to improve the following two aspects to make the stay more memorable:

1. The 4 veg and 3 non veg dishes which are prepared and served fresh in the buffet needs to be served quickly and the guests should be briefed about this or the same should be mentioned in the menu card.On the two occasions I and my son opted for the buffet we missed these accompaniments.The waiters themselves were complaining of the delay by the kitchen.

2. More efficient coordination between the front desk and the car rental manager.",1,1,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,3,1
"This is one of the finest hospitality hotel, With excellent staff at front & Restaurant. I spend 4 days happily. The fast and excellent service amazing... All staffs strive for service,, Enjoyed the food and wifi which is a best in this property. Next to Total mall so you can enjoy any other food you need, Rooms are like 1BHK flat and you can take your family and the living will be magnanimous, Enjoy this hotel have a cab to go into city and this hotel is on 4th floor,the GYM is good and the Swimming pool to be done which is on roof top _Rest all the best stay guranteed",1,1,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,1,3
"We stayed here for four days. we had taken two suites for our family of four.The suites are beautiful, very spacious, luxurious, centrally airconditioned, free highspeed WIFI. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The complimentary breakfast was sumptuous and complete.The restaurant food specially the buffet is excellent.Eventhough the prices are on the higher side its worth eating at the restaurant. Hotel is at a convenient place, surrounded by form malls and shopping places. Overall this hotel is highly recommended. Ms. Asfiya the Front Office manager is very helpful. Tremendous experience at this place, Will look forward to the same.",1,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,1
"Excellent rooms, excellent service , well connected ... exotic buffet menu and the best part of the hotel is that I can cook in the room .Rooms could be a little brighter.Buffet spread for breakfast is fantastic , they also offer japanese food .Overall a good place to stay ..",1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"Excellent stay overall and great food!

But the parking procedure is very bad and upsetting. Since the hotel has a common basement parking with the Total Mall, the ticket issuers in the basement are being rude to the guests. No parking pass was issued to me by Davanam during my check in. While going out, I was directed towards the backside exit where I was asked to pay for the parking. Later, when I enquired, the concierge said that I could just park for free and made no mention of any hotel pass. However, the ticket issuers in the basement blocked my car even the next day and questioned me on why my car was parked overnight without any pass or parking ticket. This lack of coordination between the hotel and the basement parking attendants has to be looked into seriously.",1,3,3,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3
"We stayed here for four days. we had taken two suites for our family of four.The suites are beautiful, very spacious, luxurious, centrally airconditioned, free highspeed WIFI. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.Mr Ather at the reception desk was very helpful in booking the rooms and was instrumental in providing a free late checkout.
The complimentary breakfast was sumptuous and complete.The restaurant food specially the buffet is excellent.Eventhough the prices are on the higher side its worth eating at the restaurant.
Hotel is at a convenient place, surrounded by malls and shopping places
As for transport to and fro , one would easily get frustrated by the deceiving Auto drivers and Taxidrivers.
Overall this hotel is highly recommended",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1
"I recently stayed for a few days and I can recommend
this property in every aspect.
The hotel has very good rooms and the service is
very prompt and the breakfast is of good quality.
The wi fi is also good.",1,1,1,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,1
"Davanam is a little known hotel in Bangalore. It is in the vicinity of Koramangala (Total Mall Building on Hosur Road). the good point of the hotel is the large suite rooms. very spacious and good rooms. it has a refrigerator (large and not a mini bar) which helps keep the drinks etc very cool. The Hotel has a good buffet breakfast and a good business center. Overall a perfect business hotel if you have work in Koramangala, HSR, Hosur road, JP nagar, Jayanagar etc. Even Electonic city and Sarjapur road are 15-20 mins away due to the flyovers connectvity. Overall great value for money.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"it was first time i have seen such a wonderful hotel. fantastic rooms, superb location decent staff and quality food. i had stayed in the hotel for 3 days and i was happy on my decision choosing this hotel. i would like to suggest that minibar needs to be stocked with more items as it is a big fridge and Pool area should be used for dinners as it gives you fantastic view.",1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
The bill should be checked thoroughly as there is Too much of cheating which cannot be forgiven. They made us wait for an hour searching for the wrong Bill and they failed in it. 5k extra by repeating the same bill in a different time. Other than that it was above par in every perspective.,2,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3
"If you're a Couple i recommend you to choose it. Excellent spacious room with excellent WIFI ,A/C and other stuffs. Well if you're a foodie its a special treat for you with the complimentary breakfast. It was just delicious. The quality of service was a bit slow you have to care for your patience. Overall i must say I found it to be the best hotel to stay in Bangalore.",1,1,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3
"I got to stay at Davanam Sarovar Portico Suites during my previous business visit to Bangalore

and I should say it was an absolutely great experience staying there. The levels of hospitality

that the hotel staff rendered was amazing- right from the junior-most staff to the senior-
most- itâ€™s totally incomparable; in fact, I was greatly surprised to get such warm hospitality

and excellent amenities at such reasonable prices. Great rooms, great food and great facility!

The rooms were spacious and tech savvy. I would love to stay there during all my subsequent
business trips to Bangalore.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3
"I stayed at Davanam Sarovar Portico Suites for 4 days along with my family. The room service

was quite fast enough and prompt and other staffs were really helpful.

The complimentary breakfast was delicious and we enjoyed having dinner too. The room was

quite spacious. The quality of service and hospitality was good. I feel itâ€™s the best place to stay

with family and chill out.

Situated in a central location, Davanam offers fast Wi-Fi, Indian-cum Italian food, and other

basic amenities, like hair dryer, coffee maker, etc.",1,1,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3
"From the beginning to the end, this was undoubtedly the best hotel stay and service that I

ever experienced in my lifetime. The check-in was excellently smooth and the staff service

was great at each and every level thereafter. Service across all the departments of the hotel

was excellent, from front office to housekeeping, from concierge to restaurant. The rooms

and lobbies were spacious and neatly maintained. Such attention to every minute aspect

of the hotel customers cannot be achieved without a good management- so I would like to

congratulate the entire Davanam team! You can count on me as a loyal Davanam customer

during all my Bangalore visits!",1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1
"A delightful business tour to remember

I am a marketing manager staying at Delhi and I need to travel across the country for client

meetings. In such conditions, I always expect a comfortable stay so as to concentrate on my

professional activity. In my last tour to Bangalore, I was bit confused to choose a location to

book the hotel for stay, thereafter one of my colleagues proposed Davanam Sarovar Portico

Suites.

When I reached the hotel, I found that the exterior was not so much fascinating but the

location was pretty good. After stepping in, the royal and courteous hospitality overwhelmed

me. The rooms were also spacious and well polished. The staff was very humble and

cooperative. The hotel was ideal for business meetings, even my clients appreciated it. I stayed

there for week and enjoyed a lot. Thanks Davanam for a great service!",1,3,1,3,1,3,3,1,3,3,1
"I work as a professional news channel camera man and usually visit Bangalore to capture events. This time, our team booked a suite at Davanam. We stayed there for 15 days and usually my team used to retreat late due to work load and the late night service at Davanam was excellent. The restaurant at the hotel also serves late night and quality of the food was also impressive.

Rooms are very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed very good sleep. The hotel is well equipped with optimum amenity and the room service was also excellent. Only once the fluctuating WI-FI worried us, but it was sorted out immediately by the hotel staff. Really, the experience was recommendable and great with Davanam.",1,1,1,3,3,1,0,3,3,3,1
"The rooms are of considerably good size and well-equipped.

Here is a list of all the positive things:

1) Decent, neat and clean rooms

2) Large and clean bathroom

3) People at reception are polite and well-behaved

4) There is no sort of language barrier as every member of the crew speak neat English

5) Very close to major attractions in Bangalore and also to the cityâ€™s IT center.

6) Free Wi-Fi with a decent speed

Few negative things:

1) Services by the in-house restaurant are a bit slow

2) Close proximity to the main road that makes it a little noisy inside",1,3,1,3,3,1,3,3,1,1,1
"I am a business owner based in Bangalore. Recently, I had to arrange accommodation for one

of my clientsâ€™ stay in the city and was looking out for a decent hotel located in the city centre.

When browsing through reviews of business hotels, I came across a couple of good reviews for

Davanam Sarovar Portico Suites in Madivala and the prices also seemed to be reasonable. I

went ahead and made the reservations.

Before departure, my clients were full of praise for booking such a great hotel. They seemed

to have experienced a pleasant stay and my business meetings were also held in the same

premises without hassles of any kind. Davanam definitely has every amenity that a business

person would need. Iâ€™m glad to have discovered such a good hotel at quite reasonable prices.

Iâ€™ve decided all my business meets and client stays would be arranged at Davanam hereon.",1,3,3,1,3,3,1,3,3,3,3
"Last week, I had to go on a business trip to Bangalore and personal circumstances required my wife also to accompany me. So, I had to find a good business hotel for my client meet and at the same time it had to be a good place for staying with family as well. This is when one of my acquaintances from Bangalore recommended Davanam Sarovar Portico Suites. I took his word and booked a deluxe suite.
Frankly, I never repented a moment of my stay here. Before checking in, I was skeptical about how my wife would spend her time when I was busy with my business meeting. But, the shopping mall located just beside the hotel kept her occupied during our stay. As for the service, I never expected such good service and amenities at such a reasonable cost. The room was sparkling clean and the whole ambience looked hygienic.
I look forward to stay at Davanam during all my subsequent visits, irrespective of whether it would be a business trip or family vacation!",1,3,1,1,3,3,1,3,1,3,3
"I was referred to Sarovar Porticos Suits, Bangalore by a trusted business associate. When I was planning a visit to the city with family, I was apprehensive since I was taking my family on vacation to Bangalore for the first time. Being from Dubai, my fussy kids are used to luxury; and a spic and span life style. Loo and behold, to my relief, we found just that here. The food was great and the waiters were kind as to modify certain dishes to our taste. Weâ€™re thankful for the wonderful stay!",1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
"I stayed at DavanamSarovar a few weeks back on a business trip to Bangalore. At first look, from the outside, I must admit, I didnâ€™t think it would be a match to the best of 5 star hotels in the city but was pleasantly surprised when I entered the lounge area. The reception desk attendants were polite and helpful. The rooms were spacious and had a lovely view from the 5th floor of the freeway and greenery that Bangalore is known for. I would sure recommend this hotel to my friends and business associates. Kudos! Keep it up!",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1
"I was on a hunt for the best family hotel in Bangalore for my relatives; they had planned their stay for ten days and were looking for the best possible option. I came across Davanam Sarovar Portico Suites and recommended them the same!
They were full of praise after their tour; they thanked me million times for suggesting this reasonably priced, well-equipped hotel. Itâ€™s worth to stay in this luxurious place. I was in a dilemma, before suggesting and but after getting their feedback, I donâ€™t give a second thought if Iâ€™ve to suggest to any of my friends and family or myself ;-)",1,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
"I stayed in Davanam Sarovar Portico Suites for around 3 days during my business trip. The hotel had all the amenities that I indeed wanted.
Since I prefer homely food, I didnâ€™t find the menu here so attracting, but it was delicious, though I had to wait for a long time, after placing my order. The wireless connectivity worked in my favor, so I had the chance to go and work in the spacious lobby for a while.
I didnâ€™t find any difficultly in terms of transportation, as the hotel management had arranged me a taxi (cab) service that arrived and dropped me on time.",1,1,1,3,3,3,1,3,3,1,3
"During my recent official visit to Bangalore, I happened to stay at Davanam Sarovar Portico Suites. My stay at the place was very pleasant with negligible hitches. The lounge and the rooms were elegantly decorated with fully contemporary interiors. Davanam was recommended by a colleague who has stayed here several times before and I should say I was also totally impressed with the place and I plan to reserve accommodation here during my next visit to Bangalore with family.
The check-in was quick, efficient and friendly. The staff was second to none with respect to courteous service and customer focus. The room was clean and comfortable with all modern amenities. The in-house Tangerine restaurant offers a delicious range of local and international cuisine; the bar also serves a variety of drinks and cocktails with light snacks.
On the flipside, the hotelâ€™s location at the market place doesnâ€™t make it an ideal location.
Overall, I would recommend it to others too!",1,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,2,1,1
"Whenever I go to Bangalore, Davanam Sarovar has been the place I choose to stay. This time, I stayed with my whole family on our holiday to the garden city. Once again, I should admit that the hotel and service was wonderful. Everything from the welcoming attitude of the staff at the front desk and comfortable room to the cuisine at the restaurant and all other modern facilities, the place made our stay a pleasant one.

The mall right next to Davanam drove our boredom away when we had no outing plans. Except for the buzz of the market place near the hotel, thereâ€™s nothing to crib about. I would rate it 4.5 stars out of 5.",1,3,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,1,1
"From outside, the property might not appear appealing. So when I first entered the rooms I was greatly surprised. They are spacious, and very well maintained. Even the restaurants near the reception offer nice food. A nice place to stay in Bangalore.",1,1,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3
"I really enjoyed this property! The idea of the hotel is adorable, stayed on the 5th floor, spacious suite room and was the perfect amount of space for a business traveler. Didn't really use the kitchenette, but it was great to have the fridge and probably would have used it if I was there longer. I stayed only 5 nights. Air conditioning in room worked great.
I did not rent a car and didn't need one.
There is a shopping mall just a couple of blocks down to go get food and drinks. Lots of food choices within walking distance.
Front desk staff was great. All the staff we encountered were great. No problems at all.

I would definitely stay here again.",1,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3
"I chose this hotel for my stay as it was closer to my relative's place. Currently, only few floors are functional. However, the size and quality of the rooms takes you by surprise. It is amazingly spacious with a full fledged sofa and all other luxuries in your suite. The staff is humble and polite. It has a big restaurant with tasty food all the way. The location is just awesome, with close proximity to The Forum and Total Malls. Add to it the value for money preposition and it becomes a deal, too good to resist.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,1
"We were staying in room 615. there were only two points i noticed which were average in hotel. 1) Low light on laptop table, hence requested for Lamp(which was provided instantly). 2) Absence of Remote for AC.
Rest the stay for 3 nights was wonderful.. Excellent hospitality, food, service.. House keeping staff was very supportive. Location is right inside the Total Mall and is well connected to city.. in all an excellent business hotel..",1,1,1,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,2
"With elegant rooms of modern interior, tastefully decorated furniture and colorful tones, Davanam Sarovar Portico Suites is probably one of the best choices for both personal and official ravels. I had been here with my friends and enjoyed the whole stay.

All rooms are quite spacious and are being offered with basic amenities, including microwave, attached bathroom with modern shower facilities, flat-screen TV. Our evenings were well spent with some snacks and international cocktails at the Gallop Bar, which I especially enjoyed for its ambiance.

The only that put me off was the time taken by staffs to bring the food to our suite. But the delicious food and wide range of food choices compensated for the same. If this point is ruled out, I would easily give it a 5 star rating for its comfort, amenities and nice location and nice stay.",1,1,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"Davanam Sarovar took me by surprise for the price they charged me for booking a room there. Its location is probably its biggest selling point thanks to its proximity to areas like Kormangala, BTM, and easy access to IT hubs like Electronic City. This really helped me during my stay as all my business and leisure work was easily done without going too far from the hotel.

Icing on the cake were the spacious rooms along with the excellent choice of outdoor swimming pool, and gym fitness center. What more every time the hotel is placed just next to one of the leading city malls in Bangalore. The mall has a wide range of restaurant and eat-out choices including McDonaldâ€™s and KFC.

I had been on a business trip, and right about everything offered by the hotel made my trip all the more worthwhile and relaxing. It is a bit expensive in comparison to other similar biz hotels in the city, but if youâ€™re looking for luxurious hotel with spacious rooms and easy connectivity to main areas of Bangalore, then Davanam Sarovar is the one.",1,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,1
"Trouble started on arrival in Bangalore. The only contact number they had sent me was a mobile number which I tried calling on arrival at Bangalore airport, around 11PM - I wanted to check if they had a restaurant or room service that would be operational around midnight so that I could have a light dinner. No one picked up the phone thrice. Finally I got a call back with an irritated person on the other side who turned out to be a manager of the hotel who was off-duty and had been woken up by my calls. Don't know why the hotel sent his personal number.

On reaching the hotel, I found the restaurant was closed but they had a very extensive room service menu. However, on trying to order, I found that they had nothing but only 1-2 of the items listed. No reason shared why nothing else was available.

I ordered whatever they had which was barely passable.

Internet was patchy and signal strength varied drastically from point to point within the room.

The room was chilling cold and the thermostat didn't work. Tried turning off the airconditioning but it kept running even when turned off. Caught a cold and fell ill the next day.

The study/desk area doesn't have lights!! So you have to work in darkness, off the reflected light from other parts of the room!!

Lights wouldn't turn off from the bedside. So I had to use my phone flashlight to make my way to the bed after turning off the lights from the master switch near the door.

Never going to stay here again.",2,2,2,3,3,3,2,3,3,2,2
"What attracted me the most was the overall ambiance of the hotel, which has well-designed interiors, large rooms and spacious bathrooms. Cleanliness is maintained all throughout, especially in the bathrooms; something I am very particular about and was not disappointed with.

The staffs were very friendly and co-operative, guiding me at every point I needed. I happened to stay there with my husband, while he was on a short business trip..Though I may not necessarily recommended it for couples but for short business trips it is definitely one of the best options in the city.

There was a bit of disturbance from outside noise given the hotel is located right in the center of the cityâ€¦ But it compensates big time with its connectivity to all major IT parks..Large walk-in closets again took me by surprise as I was not expecting something like this in the given budget. Food is ok in the hotelâ€™s restaurant, but you could also try other restaurants in the nearby locations as there are plenty of them.

Overall a value for money and a very comfortable stay!!""",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
"I stayed there for about a month. The whole stay was awesome, the staff is very cooperative and friendly. Location is perfect. Rooms are clean and hygienic. The hotel also has a nice restaurant and a decent bar.",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3
"Stayed here for 2 nights when on a business trip. It was a long drive (of 2 hours) from the airport to the hotel. The hotel is in a good location and right next to a shopping centre and local market. Lots of good places to eat at walking distance. The room was very spacious, all basic amenities were available in the room and bathroom. Wi-fi and breakfast was provided as complimentary. We opted for a buffet dinner and found it very satisfying. Had a good stay and will recommend.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,1
"I booked this hotel after searching a lot over the Internet. Location is great and staff is very cooperative and friendly. Rooms are clean and hygienic. The hotel also has a nice restaurant and a decent bar, however, the orders are delivered quite late, but the overall ambience is good and appealing, which pretty much compensates.

The Total Mall, which is located right next to the hotel, is a bonus as getting anything that you need becomes extremely easy. I would recommend this hotel for a quick short business trip, as it is conveniently located from major business centres in the city. I am giving it a 5 star mostly because of its awesome location and always-at-your-service staff.",1,3,2,3,1,3,3,1,1,3,1
"Stayed here for 7 nights. This was a last minute booking and found it through online searches. The price seemed unbelievable for a hotel around this area for the room space they offered (54 SqM) with WiFi internet and breakfast included - so didnt have much expectations when I checked in at 6am after a long delayed flight. But was pleasantly surprised to find a vary spacious suite room with a clean large bathroom, walk in closet, open kitchen counter with 2 single beds. The staff specially housekeeping was extremely helpful. Got an ironing board upon request. The also setup a second cable connection for the TV near the beds and an extra table lamp for the working table. The breakfast buffet is satisfying but can certainly improve upon their Juice & sausages. The restaurant food menu is predominantly Indian & limited but proximity to Koramangla and with a McDonalds on the ground floor you're always saved. Another advantage is that the TOTAL Mall is right next door so you also have the option of stocking up the fridge in the room for longer stays. For those who like to shop their fruits & salads fresh there is also a wholesale vegetable market on the main road which is perhaps the only blemish if you're also expecting a grand approach to the hotel. The WiFi internet is amazingly fast. Certainly a great recommendation for those who have work around central need an easy access to places like Sarjapur Road, HSR Layout, Bommanahalli or BTM layout.",1,0,1,1,3,1,1,3,1,3,1
"Three of us came for a seven night stay. The suite--large bathroom with walk-in shower, walk in closet, kitchenette area (no cooking other than tea, but a generous refrigerator), a comfortable sitting area, 2 single beds (and a rollaway added, although one of us could easily have slept on the sofa in the sitting area). Very comfortable, impeccably clean, well cared for.

The staff has been wonderful--eager to help in anyway possible, very concerned that we enjoy our stay in their hotel and their city. They have a clear pride in both.

Food in the Tangerine restaurant is excellent. The breakfast offers an array of fresh fruit and juices, omelets made to order, and wonderful Indian options on a carefully tended and generous buffet that is value priced. Lunch and dinner are equally good. Again, the staff is eager to help--seeking to ensure that you enjoy your meal.

This has been a phenomenal place to stay.",1,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,1
"I had enjoyed my stay at Sarovar Portico in Ahmedabad, and I equally enjoy my stay at Davanam Sarovar Portico Suites Bangalore.

The hospitality is really nice, and I enjoyed the ambiance, and the service was fairly good for the price that you pay.

I like Tangerine but I found the service of the restaurant to be little sloppy. I didn't really mind because I was sitting with my laptop sending out some important emails but probably other patrons may not be equally comfortable waiting for 45 mins for a pizza!

I'm still giving it 5 stars, because I didn't really find anything else negative about it, and honestly I've coughed out 6k+ on crappy hotels with PATHETIC service in past, and probably that's why I'm giving 5 stars to Sarovar Portico in relative terms.

If you're staying in Bangalore for a short duration, and have most of your work in city center, then this is probably one of the better picks among hotels in Koramangala, hosur road, and Madivala, but if you need to be only near the airport then probably you should consider the other options.",1,2,1,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,1
"Based on good reviews from trip advisor, we had booked a premium suite during our stay starting 15th Dec. 2013.

Must say that the property is located in a very strategic place alongside Total Mall in Madivala. On the right side of the property is the huge vegetable market.

Based on the reviews we where really looking forward to our stay in Sarovar. We where awe struck with the size of the rooms (2 bhk with 2 bathrooms, hall, kitchen, study area etc.). It is huge, and getting such a space at this price in a 5 star hotel will be next to impossible.

However our issues started upon checking to the room. a) Upon turning on the tap dirty red water came out from all the taps, b) Air condition for the master bedroom was not working, c) We had difficult connecting to the free wireless internet. It looked like the room was not used for a long time and neither was the room checked by Housekeeping before checking us in, else would their be any valid reason why red dirty water is coming out of the taps.

Finally after several complains when the Air Con just didnâ€™t work, the staff decided to move us to another premium suite and told us to wait for half an hour while they got the suite ready. By then you can imagine our frustration, wherein we have 2 children, comprising of a small infant, not able to use the bathrooms after a long flight journey from another state.

Finally we were shifted to another Premium Suite which comparatively was much better then the previous one, although the bathroom tiles, and various places in the rooms were filled with dust.

The bathroom fittings were rusted in few places, and made us wonder as to why such a nice property was being treated so badly.

Then started our trauma of FREE wireless internet. While the staff tried their best to help us to connect to connect multiple device to the net via a router, however due to there poor internet connections, we faced connectivity issues every single time.

Moreover once again we faced issues with the AC not working and where told the chiller is being restarted and within 15 mins the AC will be cooling.

Amenities promised such as induction plate, microwave oven was not kept in the room and was placed only upon request. (Even then availability was not confirmed and they stated they will confirm back) Made me wonder why was the same being advertised as a standard amenity.

The breakfast buffet was good and so was the food quality in the in-room dining. They do have infant menu as well.

With regards to the Airport transfer that we had booked and paid for separately when we called up the front desk to re-confirm our drop to the Airport, he mentioned that the Airport transfer has been arranged and it is a complimentary service. We inturn had to remind him that we have paid for the Airport transfer since we preferred a bigger car for our number of suitcases and was not a complimentary service.

This made us wonder if the front desk is actually looking at the guest reservation details before expressing such statements.

During our check-out we happened to met with the Manager and informed him about the issues with the AC and the Internet that we had faced during our stay, and he did mention that they are shortly planning to migrate to another internet service provider as they are facing lot of issues with the current one. However he himself was shocked when he heard about the Air Con malfunctioning issues and the red water tap issues and did apologies for the same.

However we where saddened to see that such a nice property is not being maintained well, and if it goes at this rate soon the place will look worn out. The Sarovar team needs to put in additional efforts to ensure the property is brought up to mark with other star hotels as they have a gem of a property in a wonderful location.",2,1,3,1,3,3,2,2,3,3,2
"We had booked this place well in advance via an internet travelling site. The location of the hotel is good and easily accessible. The hotel itself is on the 4th floor of a large commercial building/mall. We had stayed in the ""executive suite"". It had all the amenities that any 4 star hotel would have except for great views. The window in our suite was over looking the central court of a mall. But the comfortable room more then made up for lack of view.

The staff were very friendly and helpful. The restaurant/bar had good a good ambience but was slightly expensive.

Also carpeted passages/corridors were an excellent things. There is nothing more annoying then listening to people moving around in long corridors in a hotel.

The only negative was the AC was not working at full efficiency at cooling.",1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3
"This hotel is located in the midst of highly congested traffic on one of the biggest, busiest road in Bangalore. Most rooms have a view of grinding traffic on one side and slums on the other. The hotel makes up for the cramped location with extra spacious rooms for the price, great breakfast area and breakfast, decent dinner with good variety, and helpful staff. Overall stay for a family can be fairly comfortable, but not much for kids there. Blaring music during dinner was not very family friendly -- the dinner room seemed like a gathering place for young professionals after work.",0,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"Too good suites.. best business suites.. have place to do discussion.. breakfast is good.. location..near mall.. what more do you ask in business trip... koramangala is not far away for your night out.. looking at tripadvisor rating, I feel visitors have been just lazy.. I'm also providing review after 8 months.. :-)",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3
"This property is the best business hotel i have evr stayedin Bangalore. I often go to Banaglore for business and preferrably stay there. I remember once i had some issues with the restaurant staff and room but Vasanth Raj (then Front Office Manager) was able to help me out ina decent manner. Staff is friendly. USP of this hotel is big room and gives you what most of the otherhotels would be able to give you only in suites. Food quality and taste is good. I recommend Sarovar to equip their Mini Bar (Fridge).
I am very happy to stay in Davanam Sarovar.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,1,3
"This property is the best available in the location. The rooms are big and gives you what most of the other hotels would be able to give you only in suites.

"I am very happy to stay in Davanam Sarovar.

All hotel managers & staff are all friendly like stay in a big family.

Hotel front office team is always attentive with detail considers stand on guest's view and provided immediately professional & valued added service.

I enjoyed the extremely big rooms, the food breakfast and dinner was delicious , friendly Stuff and manager, around 800 TV channel , Excellent Wifi Speed, Toilets and bath is very clean, Fridge and freezer cool, Thanks to Davanam Sarovar Portico team. See you again on next March 2014.",1,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,3,3

Thank you so much for a memorable time and a wonderful conference at Bengaluru.",1,1,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3
"Went there for a week, but although price is very good a d rooms ate extremely big, food is bad, breakfast not so good and cleaness, like all medium-class hotels in Ãndia are poor.
Rooms are dark and mine had 2 lamps burnt. I asked maintenance and nothing happens. 2 TV sets, but the one in front of the bed never worked.
Towels dirty",2,2,2,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3
"I had stayed for a day at the hotel for a business trip to accompany a visiting colleague and had a very nice experience putting up here. The hotel is located close to Koramangala and also has good connectivity for Banerghatta road where many IT offices are located. Even though the nearby area is little noisy due to its location right on a busy highway once you are inside you would hardly notice what's outside.

The rooms are quite spacious with all basic amenities and are very neat and clean. The staff is very courteous and helpful ensuring a pleasant stay after office hours. The food is also good with the breakfast, lunch or dinner buffet offering good variety of cuisines (can speak for vegetarian).

Overall, when you compare Sarovar Portico with other high-end 5-start hotels this will definitely not burn your pockets and offer you nice stay, nice food and nice ambiance without compromising anywhere on quality. Unless you have location constraints for business travel this place is a nice business hotel !!!",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3
"Excellent choice if you want to be in a comfortable nice place. facilities within the hotel are very good as well. good for families and friends. The breakfast buffet was really good. The service was outstanding ( five star ), would like to specially thank Miss Atfiya for all support and help that she provided us. She was very friendly and kind. Would love going back again. Thank you",1,1,1,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3
"This is fairly new property.For the money I paid roughly $90 a night then I'd say it is quite good.If on the other hand you need a top notch 5 star hotel then this us not it.The hotel rooms are all suites with full kitchen ,living room ,bedroom,large walk in closet and good sized bathroom.I had the basic deluxe suite and room was fine for the money.On arrival my room had no internet router and so I had no internet.It took the staff at great from me telling them I would check out to finally get a router set up in my room.The hotel bills itself as having free internet throughout but this us not true if you are an international traveler using your home mobile service on roaming as I do.If you have an Indian mobile number then they get you on an Airtel plan but it is a drill.Free open wifi are as international traveler knows is not what is available here.So I had good wifi in my room once they set up the router but I did not gave any wifi anywhere else.The staff is very eager to please and really there is no complaint about the very friendly service.The property is big but the the quality of the construction ,finishing,carpeting,flooring reminded on Indian hotel of the 80's. Again for the money it us very acceptable but had they paid attention to construction details they could easily have made this a top notch property. The bathrooms are very basic but with a good overhead shower.You get one bar of soap and one small tiny shampoo,no face cloths,no hand towels a bathrobe that will fit a petite woman that weighs 50 kgs and that is it.They could seriously improve this.We all want to save the environment but to give 2 full size towels instead of different sizes is not being Eco friendly.You wash your hands and you need to use a full size towel. You want to shave and there is no face towel or hand towels....makes no sense.Kitchenette is equipped but again no towel,no kitchen cloths ...,so why have a kitchen.My room had a full fridge with beer and wine and very limited else...this also could be improved.Cleanliness is just acceptable.Could definitely improve as they use no vacuum cleaners and it shows.All in all I would repeat the stay as there is value for the money,the staff is very friendly,breakfast is very good,in room dining was quick and efficient,bed was comfortable even with very poor quality linens and room was big for a suite.Plus you get 2 TV's.If you are an international traveler make sure you ask for a router in your room.",2,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,2
"Hi, I was in Davanam Sarovar Portico, Bangalore. It was very good experience. Asfiya, Reuben & Karthik was very helpful. Very friendly and Service was really good. Suite style rooms are Great.

"Yes! I bet you can challenge your expectation when you walk into the Davanam Sarovar Suites, Bangalore as what they have to offer you at the price you pay for you can always expect much more than what you imagine. The spacious living room is ideal for sitting together with well designed interiors and the huge spacious bathroom. The kitchennet as well as the facilities is really very well done. It will be a place to be in for both official as well as personal ravels. It defines luxury at the most affordable price.A very good selection of food and bverages makes the stay excellent.",1,1,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,1
"The rooms (all individual suite style) are great â€“ plenty of room and filled with all necessary creature comforts! And as a long-stay guest, theyâ€™re idealâ€¦
Friendliness and Service â€“ Cannot beat it â€“ a big shout out to Karthik, Reuben and Asfiya at Front of House, to Jipin, Neeraj, Santosh and Mohan (and many more) in the Dining room for preparing and serving all my requests and also to all the Security guys for just being there when needed!
Good Location â€“ Right next to a Mall â€“ even the market is an experience!
Things to Come - I think that when the improvements / renovations have been completed on the 8th floor â€“ then it will be the place to be â€“ that view (especially at Sunset) is amazing!!
Going the extra mile - Just wanted to say a special thank-you to the General Manager for definitely going the extra mile and delivering on promised service!!!
Final Comments â€“ definitely worth staying here â€“ Long or short â€“termâ€¦",1,1,1,3,0,3,3,1,3,3,3
"What the Davanam Sarovar Portico Suites Hotel in Koramangala, Bangalore lacks in terms of an amazing lobby and other exorbitant facilities, it makes up for in terms of excellency in what matters; the rooms / suites and super value for money.

Having stayed here in excess of 7 days with intentions of coming back for more, I can recommend this Suite Hotel to business travelers and others whom would like to stay close to the sites and companies around the Koramangala area of Bangalore.

Here are my pros and cons about this suite hotel in the Koramangala area of Bangalore;

Proâ€™s:
- wonderful suites, I actually feel right at home
- management takes their responsibility of making guests feel at home very seriously
- internet is relatively fast â€“ the hotel was kind enough to install a router in my room so that I could use all my (4) devices without problem
- security personnel are very friendly and professional
- personnel working in the restaurant also act very customer focused and service minded
- the location in Koramangala
- there is a mall next door â€“ great for the little things you might need
- TV comes with lots of English channels, and there is a TV in the living room as well as the bed room
- there is a small gym â€“ nothing fancy, but it works (5th floor)
- laundry works perfectly and pricing is reasonable
- there is an authentic market right next to the hotel where you can find all kinds of fruits, vegetables etc.

When the roof top pool is completed, you will also be able to get direct access to the sun, take a dip and enjoy magnificent views of the city.

Conâ€™s;
- the staff at reception all expect one guy really seem like they donâ€™t want to be there
- the â€œkitchenâ€ in the suite really isnâ€™t much of a kitchen, but if you arenâ€™t planning on cooking, you wonâ€™t mind

Overall, I have given this hotel 5 stars based on the homely feeling as well as the excellent value for money.",1,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"This was my third stay at this property in last about six months, USP of this hotel is that all rooms are large enough with a separate living area and other amenities, over all a good place to stay and comfortable even if you stay with your family.",1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,1
"Beyond Expectation
My family of 4 recently stayed in Davanam Sarovar hotel on my husband official trip to Bangalore . On arrival we were informed that we got a free upgrade to a better room than we booked, and we were very pleasantly surprised. Our room had a 1 bedroom, kitchenette, living area, dining area work station for My husband and we were amazed as our room had two televisions one in our living area and one in our bed room . It was perfect for my husband, myself and my parents to stay.
There are so many wonderful things I love about this place:
- big, spacious & well-furnished Suites
- friendly & helpful staff
- excellent location.
- very accessible to my husband office, shopping district & main station yet away from all the noise
- safe and secure building
- reasonably priced considering the high costs of living in Bangalore.
- last but not least, breakfast is delivered was delicious where we enjoyed a lot.",1,1,3,1,3,3,1,1,3,3,1
"Stayed in Davanam Sarovor Hotel for 2N/3D in Room No: 618 â€“ The hotel is located in a Mall building at Madivala,Bangalore . Good Access to main business areas. Very large spacious rooms. Nice interiors. Good House Keeping. If you are business traveller to Electronic City this hotel can be considered. The only issue with the rooms is when you see outside youâ€™ll have the view of the Mall crowd. There is a scope for improvement in overall working of Front office team.
Breakfast is just very ordinary expected much large spread. Not happy with the Quality standards of the Food items that was served during my stay. Quality of the food served is a big question. Not happy with the food.
Renovation work was going on in next room so lot of noise in day times.",0,3,1,3,1,3,3,3,3,0,0
"This place offers all that is needed for the long stayer. Well appointed spacious suites with well furnished kitchenette. I have spent good enough duration at this hotel and found it perfect for me because i wanted to cook my own food.The staff is very cooperative and friendly. Special Thanks to, Ashfiya ,Pooja, Sherlin, Karthik, Reuben, Khiyo, Neeraj, Santosh, Kumar.(sorry i am forgetting few names) for making my stay comfortable and a pleasant one.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,1
"Entering the hotel the first impression you form is it's a budget business hotel due to its shoddy entrance and small lobby but don't be fooled once you check in the grandest of rooms awaits you.The room has a lobby, a store, a washroom, a bedroom, 2 LCD, a mini kitchen. its a fully furnished 1 BHK withservant quarter!
Before i continue i must write I have been their twice on business visits and will continue going their as its a long term business. The very first time their was a big mis match between amazing room and awful service hence i though i will give it another chance before writing as it might be a one time goof up. But nope its a constant, slow and confused service shows they lack the basic operation management skills. Example- I ordered snacks at 6:30 PM, came in at 8:00 PM with tea all cold and one grilled sandwich missing, then at 8:30 i got my sandwich and i dared not to ask for heating the tea. 11:45PM in the night i got a call from room service that my order is ready and will be served in few minutes- same order i had already eaten! I gave them a piece of my mind.
Next day at dinner buffet i waited for 45 minutes for bread and finally had rice. i asked for comb and brush kit next morning when i woke up, luckily i had my back up, i was handed over the same when i was leaving for my meeting and was crossing the lobby!
My 2 cents- stay here enjoy the room, bed LCD etc, have food outside and bring your stuff. Don't expect even a one star service standard.

P.S. -Rooms don't have a minibar, only an empty refrigerator",2,3,2,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,3
"I own a company in Madivala so the Davanam suits me well in terms of location. As a long stay guest you can't fault the hotel really. The staff are real friendly and always greet me by name. They remember how I like my room done and my breakfast in the morning! I especially think that Karthik and Rueben at front desk deserve a mention - they are always on the ball.
The rooms are spacious and modern.
The food at this hotel is amazing if you ask the chef to make something specific rather than the buffet, although that's good too - one of the best butter chicken curries and garlic butter naans in town!
I think once the pool on the roof is complete this will be the place to be!",1,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"I really liked the room and other facilities in the room. It's just like a mini suite with everything you need during your short trip. A nice welcome drink was provided. Breakfast buffet is also very good. The from management also extended our stay at the best prices. Only thing I didn't like about this place is that it is located in crowded locality and near to vegetable market which makes the location quite displeasing. Also, since the hotel is situated in the compound of a mall, there is noise all during the day.",0,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,2,1,1
"Situated at a central Location in Bengaluru, this hotel offers suites of all kinds at affordable prices. I got a free upgrade. Also, I arrived at the main restaurant 2 hours late for my complimentary buffet breakfast. I was still served with the free food. Reception, Bell desk operations are noticeably distinguished.",1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3
"This hotel is conveniently located at Madiwala ,Bangalore.
It is just opposite to Madiwala police station.If you are looking
for a hotel near Koramangala also you can go for this.You can
get well connected to any point
using BMTC services stop is just opposite.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3
"It is the only reasonable place in Hosur area for a decent meal, so went there several times.
It is a buffet with small variety of salads and huge of hot food. 100% indian food, but variety is good and deserts are the best part. When you ask for a coffee, please specify size, because they serve expresso (from machine) but in a big mug, you only receive water",0,1,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3
This hotel is unique in the sense of its rooms i.e. all rooms are suite room with lot of space. Its on the top of a mall but no disturbances are there. Room service is also good along with food quality. It keeps the name of Sarovar Group of Hotels.,1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3
Though the building is old but the hotel is clean . We had some cobwebs behind the bedroom door which may have gone unnoticed by your staff . That is very important . Parking should be made more efficient an fast .,1,3,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,3
"This is one of those good hotel which sets the benchmarks for others to achieve.
The hotel is located next to a mall and is relatively a busy place even at odd hours. Though you will find difficult to locate its main entrance if you have entered in mall first as there is no direct entrance from mall to hotel.

The staff is very soft spoken and helpful. The room size is huge with clear demarkation of living room to bedroom. The food quality is good and stay is an experience in itshelf with flowing road view from your window.

Breakfast is eloborate and overall qualty of food is decent.

I would reccomend this hotel any time.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3
"Stayed with my wife & son in the Deluxe Suite # 544 from 26th to 28th April 2013. It was like a mini-apartment.. very spacious with ultra-modern fittings in the rooms & bathroom, comfortable & luxurious.. free WiFi was included. The staff, Manager down was extremely courteous and made sure that we enjoyed our stay thoroughly. The restaurant 'Tangerine' is nice & cozy, and the buffet spread for both breakfast & dinner was royal.. Continental as well as the South Indian. The whole experience was certainly value for money, and I would definitely recommend this hotel to others. I would most certainly like to stay there again in the future!

"Not a bad hotel, situated in the middle of a local market - great if you need to pop out to buy cauliflower or a chicken ... Not so good if you want to rest ! Rooms are HUGE but this is really unnecessary. Beds comfortable and very clean. Not so impressed with breakfast provisions. Probably wont go back.",2,2,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,0
"I had stayed in this hotel for 3 days in April for a official conference. The suites are spacious, well decorated with all modern amenities. The Bathroom was huge, the bed very comfortable, price definitely reasonable considering the locale, amenities and food. Speaking abt food,breakfast spread was very lavish, so was the lunch and dinner buffet. Their dinner buffet is different on each day with entire spread based on a specific cuisine.Service was very good. I wanted my shirt to be pressed early in the morning, the staff was courteous enough to get a Ironing board, in fact he even volunteered to iron my shirt! Overall this hotel excels in every aspect, right from check in to check out. PS: The hotel is situated on top of a mall which has some good outlets like MacD.",1,1,3,3,1,3,1,3,3,3,1
"A very great experience.rooms were HUGE.Easily comparable to most hotels big suites.excellent room service.interesting artwork all around the hotel.

Be sure to ask for a room which is near the elevator.it dosent look big but the hotel it actually huge.wifi services could have been more consistent.

Definitely recommend.one of the few gems in the city of Bangalore.",1,3,3,3,1,3,1,3,3,3,1
"Barring the location of hotel , it is a great property. You get a 1 BHK at the price of a room in other hotels. The rooms are really big with all facilities in it. Defintely a place to stay for a long tenure.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
This hotel rooms and lobby is good and spacious. But I would not recommend it for conference and I found that they can not handle if group. Staff seems to be ok but courteous. I would like to stay only if family or alone but not for a conference.,0,3,3,3,3,3,1,0,3,3,3

The toiletries are of high quality and unlike those offered in any other hotels. I look forward to my next visit to this place eagerly.",1,3,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3
"We initially booked Davanam with reluctance since this was the only good suite hotel in the Koramangla, BTM and Electronic city Area.
We have been staying in Davananam for our last 3 visits and we love our stay here...

Pros -

- Great interiors, spacious rooms - One of the best we have seen in Bangalore - much better than the crampy 5 stars we have stayed across the world
- Nice location - Next to mall, easy to reach, good landmark location
- Nice Breakfast and tasty food
- Excellent service - trained and cordial staff
- Nice housing keeping
- Pick up from Airport which is 50 kms away from City
- Location for food - if you dont want to have food in Hotel, nice restaurants nearby

Cons -

- In Room Dining food is expensive ( Buffet food in the restaurant is very reasonable)
- External looks are not impressive ( and deceptive :) )
- Limited Amenities ( No swimming Pool)

My wife and kid loves the Hotel, Service, Hotel Rooms and food !

It is perfect for long and short terms stays in Bangalore....",1,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,1
This is more than one can expect. Large Suites with good interiors and comfort. Nice place to stay and have meetings with clients. Location is good for those who would like to work in the Electronic City area. Away from Airport but thats Airport's fault. Will like to stay again. Restaurant is excellent with some good menu,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3

"I stayed in this hotel for almost 2 months as part of Business travel. It is fantastic place to stay with all your luxuries taken care of. All the staff is extremely courteous - including the housekeeping, dining services and the front desk.
I just would like to give couple of feedback comments:
1. Its always good to give unlimited supply of drinking water to your customers.
2. the rooms facing inside (not road facing) do have poor cell phone reception for some service providers. (For me: Airtel was good, but Vodafone was not) See if that can be improved.",1,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3
"Once again stayed at this property and this time for an extended period of 5 days. And once again the stay was more than happy. The extent to which the staff and management goes to ensure the comfort of the travellers is really amazing. Special mention to Reuben and Karthik at front desk to manage everything effortlessly, even to the extent of filling up for housekeeping and other departments because of shortage of staff.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3

"This is a boutique hotel on the 4th to 8th floors in a mall. It has an unassuming front with a small entrance leading to the lifts witha a small cocierge and seating area. The recption lounge is on the 4th floor.The check in was swift and pleasant. the room was a pleasant surprise. You enter and walk into a lounge with art decor with a sofa, a couple od seats, and a center table with a TV. To one side is the kitchen area with a sink, counters, cabinets and a medium sized fridge. On the other side is a dressing area leading off to a small bed area. Overall the impression is a suite with open achitecture. There is a king sized bead with just enough space to move around it. The bathrooms in neither small nor largeand is crystal clean. There is a shower stall - bo tub. It takes a while for the water in the bathromm to flow hot. The bed has a firm spring mattress. with a very soft ??down quilt and a choices of large but very soft pollows. I slept like a baby all th four nights. There are electrical outlets on all walls and the lighting is soft but bright enough. Though there is a kitchen there are no utensils stove. There is an electric kettle with tea and coffee. The room has two air-cinditioning vents one in the bed area, and the other in the entrance/lounge area, both of which have temperature controls and I contols allowing me to set the room temperature comfortably. The cleaning service is excellent and every evening I came back to an absolutely clean room with everthing neatly arranged. Room service is slow but the food is excellent. I asked for and got a cheese platter (with 8 different kins of cheese). When I ordered a red snapper and it was not available, the chef rustled up a delectabl grilled pomfret. The room package included a buffet breakfast and buffet dinner, both os which had a reasonable selection of mediterranean, continental, chinese, and Indian dishes. The restaurant on the 4th floor is tastefully done up with a mix of low lounge sofas and chairs. The buffet lunch was equally good, and all three meals had a wide spread of deserts. The hotel was launched 6 months ago and seems to have been outfitted in a hurry. The ""gym"" is a room with an exercycle, a treadmill and dumbells. A borrowed an exercise mat from it and worked out in my room. There was no concierge but the security officer and any staff available helped carryn my things up to the room every day. My room ahd a glassed off window that overlooked the mall which was interesting.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1
"This was a discovery by chance for me, as the regular hotel where I normally stay was fully booked. What a lucky change it was. From the check-in to the stay and the check-out the experience was truly awesome and all that at a very affordable price. It's a just opened property in Bangalore outskirts, near the Electronic City and they offer just suites for stay. The entire experience is very discreet, top class and professional. The rooms are spacious as you expect suites to be, with a decent kitchen space, refrigerator and a living room area separated from the bedroom, squeaky clean and the staff manning the hotel are very hospitable and friendly. Special mention for front office manager Reuben, who helped us with a late check-out when we were stuck in the city because of a strike in the city. He extended the courtesy of enabling a late check-out and took care that we had no problem whatsoever in holding on to the room for as long as we desired. Overall great experience.",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,3
"No amount of good words I can say will do justice to this hotel and its staff. It was my first time in India, and my visit was a mix of business and leisure travel, so I had numerous additional requests, from sightseeing recommendations to chauffeured car arrangements to wired (as opposed to the provided wireless) Internet access. The staff handled everything perfectly; there was not one single question / request they did not have an answer/solution to. In addition, service was always provided with a smile and a friendly attitude that made my stay much more pleasant. Staff consistently went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure that my stay is nothing short of excellent.

The suites are spacious, tastefully furnished, and sparkling clean - they were above my expectations in all aspects. The restaurant on the premises offers delicious food, outstanding service, and pleasant ambiance - even my Indian co-workers said the food was excellent.

I stayed there for 8 nights and I credit this hotel and its staff for the wonderful time I had on my first trip to India - if I travel to Bangalore again, whether for business or leisure, I would not stay anywhere else.",1,3,1,3,3,3,3,1,3,3,3
"Our Skal group meeting for this month was held at this hotel. The location is a bit of a put off, but is well compensated by the lovely interiors and spacious rooms. The base category room is also laid out as a suite , about 700+ sft !!! Very tastefully done interiors .
The food was the highlight of the get together.. The starters set the tone - the chef's special chicken kabab, the paneer with wasabi sauce , the crab cakes, each one better than the other. The main course and the salads were also unusual. The desserts took the cake !!! the sheer variety of dishes offered was amazing. They even managed to make our humble Gulab jamun look and taste exotic !!
They had organised a live music session which was very good too.

"I have been staying in a lot of hotels off late because of my business travelling. As past of this I just thought of trying this new property by Sarovar at Madiwala, Bangalore. I should admit this is the best property I have ever stayed in India till now (out of some 10-15 hotels).

They only have suites and I opted for the basic one which in itself would beat any premium rooms of any other hotel. And with what I was charged for this suite, I truly believe its the best.

I only have good words for this hotel, the room would have been approx 700 sqft in size with a small kitchen area, a small hall with an LCD TV and then a big bed room with again a personal LCD.

However I did not get a chance to taste the food other than the breakfast.

One single word for this property - SUPERB !!",1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1
"A good property with excellent interiors and features situated in the centre of Madivala in Hosur main road.This new hotel is an All suit hotel with spacious rooms with separate kitchen area,sitting area, business area,spacious bed area, dressing area and a big bathroom area. I stayed in this hotel for 3 days during my business travel to Bangalore.
Their staff in the reception and in the restaurant area are well mannered and their service quality is above the normal of any average 4-5 star hotels in the city. Especially the personal interaction and supervision of their Restaurant Manager with a friendly tone will make every guest feel at home.
So I strongly recommend this hotel for any traveller to Bangalore with a budget more than INR 6K per night as it is worth of the penny you pays.",1,3,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3
"This was my first stay at Davanam Sarovar Hotel Bangalore--, when I entered the room I was thrilled by the room size.
This hotel is well-kept, well-appointed staff. From start to end I had an excellent stay. There were little small things the hotel staff did here and there to make you feel warm welcome; I can't say enough about the entire staff and the quality of service at Davanam Sarovar.
Specially the reception staff are excellent.

The rooms are nicely-furnished. The bed, honestly, is more comfortable than my bed at home--and I'm very picky when it comes to my sleeping habits. I would venture to say that the bed is the most comfortable bed in the world. I've slept in enough places to say that confidently. And the shower--wow! I LOVE the showers here--they have a wand option and also a rainfall option, with perfect water pressure.

The food is also fantastic. Their Indian dishes are delicious, but their global fare is also fantastic. Everything is presented beautifully--truly gourmet preparations and high-quality ingredients.

If you are traveling to Bangalore for business (as is my case) OR for pleasure, I strongly recommend that you consider Davanam Sarovar as your place to stay.",1,3,3,3,3,1,3,1,3,3,3

The staff were so great that all my worries turned into a comfortable stay, they provided me a wi fi complimentary which made my stay at ease part.

Being a geniuss booking.com, I had the  early checking previliege plus requested for an additojnal 2 hours.

The hotel charged me half day rent with taxes for an additional 1 hour...I should have atleast got the early check in as genius member which was not extended simply rejecting my request on the grounds that this is not guaranteed.  In my view Booling .dom should NOT claim that their genius member will be availing early checkin and that option should be removed for this nproperty atleast......this spoilt my entire trip mood

Other than the hotel staff we have not given the keys to anyone else. So we informed this matter to the reception and they were co-operative to find out how it happened and the missing item. No luck yet.

We wanted a good accommodation near Koramangala and Forum Mall. This hotel was perfect. Staffs were friendly. Food was tasty.

Always something different but it offered fresh South Indian breakfast as well as some American cuisine like an omelette bar, pastries, and parsley potatoes.

At the time of check out the duty manager asked me how was my stay, I replied pathetic and he had no reaction and he continued processing my bill as a matter of fact. A PR lady by the name of Asfiya came forward and tried her best to make up for the hotel and the staffs lopsided attitude but obviously was too late. They do not have a functional swimming pool or a health club. The Bar isnt functional as yet since they dont have a liquor license. The rooms are absolutely noisy due to the paper thin walls and the location of the hotel which is on a cross road of a very busy junction.

There is no healthy choice in food, such as brown rice, millet or quinoa, which you would find at competitor hotels such as Courtyard and Fairfield by Marriott. The reception has only one phone and 2 check-in terminals. So, the second person manning the counter has to wait for the first person to hang up to use the phone (not what you expect in a 4-star).",2,2,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3

We again made a call at 11.30 for a room change.They did not honor our request. It was 12.30 in the night and they said they will send an engineer. It was pathetic that me and my family were not able to sleep and were waiting for a technician. They just changed the air filter and it still did not work .

"The hotel is in the middle of a building site and therefore noisy from 8 AM to 8 PM. You cannot open the window or sit in the balcony because of the dust and the noise. Further, the hotel itself is still completing and kitting out the rooms above the 5th Floor where we were staying. This refurbishment works starts around 8 AM and continues until 8 PM. There is no rest from hammering and drilling. Despite our request to stop, they continued. This was not made clear at the time of booking.

"Before I start, I have to say that the hotel is very comfortable. The rooms are kept clean and well equipped and the bed is one of the best Iâ€™ve ever slept in. The staff are wonderful, everyone says â€˜hello â€“ how is your dayâ€™ and they cannot do too much to help. 

Itâ€™s a safe, secure and peaceful Indian Hotel.

And yet, there are quirks here, which can be both irritating and obstructive.

The Lift -
There are two lifts servicing 11 floors and a rooftop terrace. They are room-key operated. As far as going up and down to your own room goes, they are efficient. However, if you want to go to someone elseâ€™s floor/room for any reason, it is nigh on impossible without a manager from reception selecting that floor for you â€“ with their key. My key took me to my floor or to the terrace; to get back from the terrace, I needed it again but to get from my floor to reception I didnâ€™t. There was often a time that my colleague and I needed to work together during the day that was prevented by this (or by the bright sunlight on the roof). Furthermore, you cannot use the stairs either. Well, you can access the emergency exits but cannot then get back into a corridor. Which for my colleague on floor two was another irritation. 

Which brings me to â€¦

The Musak -
Everywhere in the hotel, piped music can be heard. In some places, much louder than in others. For example, in the lift, music is blasting away to a captive, not always appreciative, audience. On the roof terrace, it is piped out of pretend rocks. None of this would be so bad if the recordings were ok, but they crackle and pop most of the time and only one or two are by original singers. Musak should be a background event â€“ not an in your face (ears) assault.

The Bar -
This is the fourth hotel Iâ€™ve stayed at in India. This was my joint second most favourite bar. My problem is the lack of draught beer â€“ however, this is not a problem unique to this specific hotel, all of the hotels Iâ€™ve visited only sell bottled beer. However, at this bar they only sell small bottles. In this temperature and after walking along the very dusty roads outside â€“ I would have liked a large bottle. Thatâ€™s all. The staff are, as usual, attentive, pleasant and quick, and always serve a bowl of peanuts with each order.


The Terrace -
The rooftop terrace is a delight. Although I didnâ€™t use the pool, I could have. There are sun loungers provided, with towels and, if you feel the need there is a spa, which is also accessed from the terrace. However, during my visit there were two huge building projects going on opposite the pool â€“ one in front and one at the side. Relaxing in the dust and noise was not really possible. Nevertheless, I did manage to work on the roof terrace, as the internet (WiFi) was good enough to make that work possible.

As I said at the outset, this was a comfortable, clean and courteous hotel. I would go again, but I would be better prepared for the quirks.

"The Double Tree Suites are serviced apartments and easily among the best value offered to guests on business. I am a regular and a Hilton Honours Member,

The suits are spacious, clean and well appointed. The weary traveler can expect to drift off into blissful sleep thanks to the high quality beds. Bengaluru is a busy city and the din of traffic is something that gets in the way when you try to sleep. The double Tree's thick curtains dull the sounds outside to some extent. 

The dining experience though is average with limited choice, The menu is nothing much to write home about. If you are looking for Indian cuisine, there's a decent spread. I love the Masala Dosa and the idly. 

Other amenities are excellent and the hotel offers meeting rooms. Wifi is good as well. 
The staff, specially the front office and restaurant are excellent and very professional.

"As a WW traveler and a regular Hilton guest at their properties in every country I visit, I am pleased to say that this hotel is very much up to the Hilton standard. Although it is not what you would consider a splendid or grandiose property like the Hilton in many of the world's capitals, it is a clean, well-appointed facility well with a stay. The biggest asset of this hotel is its staff. They are all most accommodating, friendly, and competent. The hotel is not near the city center, which is a negative since traffic in Bangalore is horrendous most of the time, and often even worse. However, the hotel has their own fleet of vehicles which I used often to be driven to, or picked-up from various locations. There was never an issue with availability. In addition to the staff service, the hotel food was also very good, and none of us had any issues.",1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,2,3,3
"Me and my family stayed in the Doubletree for 3 months and i can we had an amazing time! The hotel is clean, modern and well equipped and nicely decorated. In 3 months i never seen anything out of place. There are two pools in the terrace where you can see the surrounding area, and once a week you can see the fighter jets going past. The bar on the ground floor is also nice and has all you need in a bar, comfy seats, cable tv and a good selection of drinks. However what i really like about this hotel is the staff. From all the hotels i have been in the world I have never met such tight band of brothers. I didn't came across a single member of staff who wasn't polite and welcoming. Just to name a few..Shaily who always came to greet us, always ready to help, and made sure our last day was unforgettable, Shabnam (who always made sure my brown eyed girl never felt left out) Samir and Samson( fast, funny, hardworking, with the most amazing memory)Vjay the invisible ninja (the nicest men ever) Yogesh who deserves a medal for being able to clean our room, often around me and the children who pestered him nonstop. Fast, hardworking, polite and very,very patient! And all the others, managers, security, dormem, maintenance, Chefs, shop owner, and the amazing doctor that came to our rescue a few times..You are all amazing!

Another great stay at this hotel. Staff as attentive as last time. The breakfast was better this time as I found that I could ask for the sausages to be put on the grill to make them a bit more golden brown and looking and tasting European.

"Do not stay here. Hotel rooms are all one color of beige and padded - reminds you of an asylum. There is an apartment building about 5 meters away, so you can't enjoy any natural light or use the balcony. The room has so much furniture in it that you cannot walk without bumping into something. The food is greasy and not good. The service in the restaurants is terrible. It took 2.5 hours to eat a regular meal that had bad cold food from sitting around. After asking for the check 20 mins earlier, I left and they chased me down to pay. Upon being told that I was not happy, they said come back again and we will make sure it is better. No. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. You didn't make it right, as you promise in the advertising, so you do not get a second chance to make a fool of me.",1,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,2

The gym was good but needed some minor updates and fixes.
The pool was rather small and the jacuzzi wasn't really circulating water, both are on the roof terrace which is nice.

"This was the worst Hilton I've stayed at from a customer service standpoint. The lady at the front desk looked at me as if she was doing me a favour by checking me in. I'd arrived a bit earlier than check in time as my flight landed from London. No smile, very matter of factly, no apologies- just says I cannot check you in now unless you pay early check in charges. I understand that it is at the hotel's discretion, however that attitude was unexpected.

I'd made this booking on my app and missed adding my husband's name as the additional guest. I was told I'll have to pay additional double occupancy charges at check in. However, I chose to call the Hilton call centre that fixed this in a minute without any questions or additional charges. The front desk at this hotel needs training on their own processes.
I had to call & ask what are breakfast timings around here etc. That's when they remembered to tell me that I have access to the bar at happy hour (I was told after it had ended) without any apologies.

The manager, Rames wanted feedback and spoke to my husband and myself. After sharing all of this feedback, he promises to make it right. I was sent 2 additional apples to my room that evening (eyeroll... thank you Hilton!). The next morning, we were told that the staff had forgotten to give us a welcome letter that has details about timings for breakfast, happy hour etc.

As a gold HHonors member, I've always been treated well for my loyalty. Just in January, I've stayed at Hiltons in Vietnam, Chicago and Bangalore. But I have to admit, I felt the most unwelcome at this Doubletree. Will not recommend this one.",2,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,2,3

-The bill presented at check-out was not what was offered to us at booking. We had to present our invoice to convince the staff.
-Some other guest's large food bill was wrongly charged to our bill. Again, we had to convince the staff that we had been out the whole day and it was not possible for us to be in two places at the same time.
- We were paying for one full day extra since our incoming & outgoing flights were early morning. The duty managers kindly requested us to contact them for a favourable offer. When we did, the offer was almost 50% more than that offered by Booking.com etc without any reduction for the non-usage. We were constrained to decline their offer.
- Hot water does not flow readily in the bathroom taps/shower. Water has to flow for a long time before it gets hot.
- The cost of airport-transfer provided by the hotel is very exorbitant (upto 150% more!) compared to other hotels and taxi-service providers.
- The cold-cuts presented in the breakfast-buffet were brown & dry around the edges.

The dinner on the first night was very bad with the starters being second time fried and presented as fresh ones. The salad was all dried and food was bad. The water served was tap water without purification and when pointed out the same bottled water was given. The chef and the f&b manager apologised however our dinner was spoilt inspite of paying such a huge amount.The dinner in the second day was ok.

They went out of the way to entertain him and keep him busy whenever we crossed the lobby or were dining at their fabulous Limelight restaurant. The food was great along with the service! I would definitely go back there again. The only issue was on the first night when we got in, we realized that our room was very small and kind of dated compared to the pictures on their website. We requested a change and they gave us a larger room within minutes. This room was a little dated as well and overlooked a wall. However, it was spacious, clean and big.

View is over slums which isn't good. Restaurant did a buffet which was ok but nothing special and 900 rupees which is about £12 and expensive for buffets in India.

We did however have some issue with our our luggage, and it took a whole 24 hours delay to receive. I do believe some of the fault lie with the hotel, it's tracking system and picking up bags from the aiport.It was not pleasant to wear the same clothes for nearly 3 days. Great room service but a nasty shock we could not use the pool all afternoon because of a private function. Disappointing.

"On the far side of the hotel, at the employee entrance, there is a sign that states ""through these doors come the best hoteliers in the world"". It is certainly a bit boastful as a statement, but the folks at the hotel certainly try to live up to that reputation. Service is excellent, friendly, whether tip is given or not. Once, when I came back, I had the pleasant surprise to see all my dirty laundry folded nicely (no, I did not leave it on the bed!), and both teddy bears I bought for my daughters put delicately on the bed - that is the kind of attention that create pretty sweet memories! They have three excellent restaurants, one of which has a terrasse, which is pretty comfortable. On Friday and Saturday, they had singers and deejays, which was pretty cool. Rooms are cleaned and well-maintained, even if the building is old (which is actually giving it a nice cachet). I saw them cleaning my room, it was pretty thorough, leaving a nice scent, another memory-making attention. Gym is small but efficient, pool is a bit small but also functional. Pricing for ancilliary services (taxis, business center) is reasonable. Only downside - this is far from downtown, and the neighborhood isn't the best (not a slum though), albeit there is a shopping center about a mile away. It is close to the old airport now used by the military, so you may see infrequently loud military planes taking off. Overall, I had a good experience there, and I will be back.",1,3,1,3,3,1,1,1,3,3,1

Of particular note is the Ginseng chinese restaurant in the hotel, the food there is unbelievable and highly highly recommended to all.

"No doubt its a good Hotel with excellent service but it lacks the maintenance. The bath tub looks old & by looking at it, makes me assume that thousands of people must have used it before me which kills the mood for relaxing moment after a long day. Its written at the reception that the hotel has heated swimmin pool, but its just a regular one which will be equally cold compared to others. Adding to that the swimming pool again is old & rustic & not in a good way. Having said that my stay was made very comfortable, thanx to the staff. The staff was very prompt & quick.

"The hotel room was dirty with a musty mouldy smell. When I mentioned this, they offered to spray perfume over it. Of course masking the smell doesn't help this health hazard. We felt sick after a few minutes in the room. We went to get some fresh air. Getting to the pool was a maze. When we finally reached, there were sticky Indian menu serving greasy options, nothing interesting. Looked around and realised I was sitting under a tube light with a lose wire dangling above me and seemed to be hanging in place by the wire itself. I went back to the room and opened the curtains and there were stains all over the window. The hotel said the floor was under construction. When I had checked in, they said don't worry- it's a great room! The wasn't. Im not saying that it wasn't worth the money, maybe there are better rooms at this hotel, but I had to leave. I was even willing to sacrifice the room rate, since the hotel refused to refund it. I find this service and overall experience was miserable, that too - on my wife's birthday! We left and checked into another hotel, the leela. It was a true 5 star. If only ratings were standardised, the Royal orchid should never me in the same category as the leela.

My package (which was already paid for) included breakfast and dinner, but during check-in, I was informed my package does not include dinner. After I protested and wanted to cancel my booking, they made me wait for an hour before agreeing to include dinner in my package. Probably they wanted to earn a quick buck by denying us dinner and then making us pay the exhorbitatant charge for it separately. Not at all professional. 2. The next morning, during breakfast service, there was a huge rush for breakfast which the hotel team did not anticipate and there were many people including us who could not get breakfast due to the crowd and dishes getting exhausted.

1. Room had traffic noise floating in from the street. 2. Since my room (101) was quite close to the reception, I didn't really mind having to recharge the entry card twice a day. But it might be a pain if you are on the upper floor and have to come back on finding that it doesn't work.

Pleasant staff, nice amenities, fast WiFi, hot water most of the times, in-room tea coffee maker. The bed was comfy, the linen and towels were clean.

I was given a room on 1st floor (103) and the Air conditioner noise from the ground floor was very irritating. I did not read previous reviews where people have clearly mentioned that this is one of the main problems in this hotel. Somehow I tolerated and got used to it.
The other problem is noise from the traffic.
I found two cockroaches in my room. One was small and the other one very big which was dead. Thank fully no bed bugs.
The outer side of the windows were very dirty. The surrounding of the hotel property needs general cleaning.

The hotel staff are friendly. Lift available. I am not sure if the hotel access is user friendly for disabled. Rooms appeared generally clean but could be better. Mattress is of good quality.

Good things: The hotel staff are friendly. Lift available. I am not sure if the hotel access is user friendly for disabled. Rooms appeared generally clean but could be better. Mattress is of good quality. Room had AC and was in working condition. I think there was a generator as well. In room service was also good. Breakfast was inclusive and it was OK. When I wanted to buy some medicine from a local pharmacy the staff were happy to go and buy for me. Not so good things: I was given a room on 1st floor 103) and the Air conditioner noise from the ground floor was very irritating. I did not read previous reviews where people have clearly mentioned that this is one of the main problems in this hotel. Somehow I tolerated and got used to it. The other problem is noise from the traffic. I found two cockroaches in my room. One was small and the other one very big which was dead. Thank fully no bed bugs. The outer side of the windows were very dirty. The surrounding of the hotel property needs general cleaning.  ,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1

"I walked into the Hotel around 12:30 AM midnight and checked with the hotel regarding the check out time and was told the checkout time was 12:30 AM after 2 days (24 hrs). Though Makemytrip packages are eligible for 12 hour checkouts, I was happy that the reception manager was giving me an upgrade. But, while checking out, he caused the trouble and was saying that he mentioned 12:00 PM in the afternoon the same day. I could not stop but laughing at this guy who does not hold his promise and makes counter statements. I stepped out of the hotel around 10:00 AM the same morning with my luggage kept inside the room. The manager could have told me before and I could have kept my luggage outside as I did not intend to use the room the same day. The guy who sits at the reception needs to be more informed of the policies and should hold on his word, basics to operate in hospitality industry rather than sitting there to screw the customers and hotels brand name. Still, the Hotel is worth to visit only because of its facilities and location near IISC.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
